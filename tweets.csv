"January 6, 2021 made it clear: there is a dagger at the throat of our democracy. Tomorrow, I’m headed to Atlanta where I will discuss the road ahead in our fight for voting rights."
"Today, my administration announced that health insurers will be required to cover the cost of at-home COVID testing kits starting January 15th."
"We must be firm, resolute, and unyielding in our defense of the right to vote and to have that vote counted. We must have debate and a vote on both the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom to Vote Act."
"Today, on National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day, Jill and I want to thank the brave men and women who put their lives on the line to protect and serve our communities. Thank you for the sacrifices you and your families make to help keep Americans safe."
"My message to everyone impacted by the Marshall Fire is this: We’re here with you. I intend to do whatever it takes, as long as it takes to support you, your state and local government to help you recover and rebuild these communities."
"Harry Reid and I grew up on different sides of the country, but we came from the same place where certain values run deep. Loyalty. Faith. Resolve. Service. He was a dear friend, a great American, and a giant of our history. May he rest in peace."
America has given out over 70 million booster shots. It’s easier than ever to get a booster – and more important than ever. Get yours today:
"Yesterday afternoon, I visited Colorado to see the aftermath of the recent wildfire firsthand and meet with those impacted. As I told folks on the ground: The federal government is not going away. We’re here for you as you recover and rebuild."
"The son of tomato farmers in the Bahamas, Sidney Poitier became the first Black man to win the Academy Award for Best Actor — but the trail he blazed extended leaps and bounds beyond his background or profession. Jill and I send our love and prayers to his loved ones."
We added 6.4 million jobs last year. That’s the most jobs in any calendar year by any president in history. How? The American Rescue Plan got the economy off its back and humming again — and 200 million vaccinations got Americans out of their homes and back to work.
Record job creation. Record unemployment declines. Record increase in people in the labor force. The Biden economic plan is working — and it is getting America back to work.
"Today, the nation’s unemployment rate fell to 3.9%. That’s the sharpest one year drop in unemployment in U.S. history."
Tune in as I deliver remarks on the December 2021 jobs report.
"It is up to all of us, We the People, to stand for the rule of law. To preserve the flame of democracy. To keep the promise of America alive."
"In the face of a violent mob on January 6, House and Senate staff sprang into action to defend the Capitol and our democracy. I called some of them today to hear their stories and thank them for their courage. They are just a few of the unsung heroes of that day."
"One year ago, our democracy was attacked and our Constitution faced the gravest of threats. But We the People prevailed. Now, it’s up to us to choose what kind of nation we’re going to be."
We must never forget the officers we lost on January 6 or in the aftermath that followed. They made the ultimate sacrifice in defense of our democracy.
"Despite what the former president says, there is simply zero proof that the 2020 election results were inaccurate."
"I have said it many times, and it is no more true or real than when we think about the events of January 6: We are in a battle for the soul of America. A battle that by the grace of God, and by the goodness and greatness of this nation, we will win."
You can’t love your country only when you win. You can't obey the law only when it's convenient. You can't be patriotic when you embrace or enable lies.
Here is the truth: The former president of the United States has created and spread a web of lies about the 2020 election. He’s done so because he values power over principle. Because his bruised ego matters more to him than our democracy or Constitution.
"Last year, for the first time in our history, a president who just lost an election tried to prevent the peaceful transfer of power as a violent mob breached the Capitol. But they failed. And on this day of remembrance we must make sure that such an attack never happens again."
Tune in as I deliver remarks to mark one year since the January 6th deadly assault on the Capitol.
"One year ago today, democracy was attacked. The will of the people was under assault. And our Constitution faced the gravest of threats. I’m heading to the Capitol this morning to speak about the day of insurrection, the state of American democracy, and where we go from here."
"The Pfizer antiviral pills have the potential to dramatically alter the impact that COVID-19 has on this country and its people. That’s why yesterday, I doubled our order to 20 million treatment courses."
"Today, the CDC approved the Pfizer COVID-19 booster shot for kids ages 12-15. Boosters work — and offer the highest level of protection against Omicron. If your child is eligible, get them boosted today."
"I’m saddened to learn that Lawrence Brooks – who was the oldest surviving U.S. WWII veteran – has passed. I had the honor of speaking with him last year, and he was truly the best of America. I’m keeping his loved ones in my prayers."
"I’ll give it to you straight, as I promised that I always would: We’re going to see COVID cases continue to rise. But you have the power to protect yourself by getting vaccinated and getting boosted."
"I know COVID testing remains frustrating, but we are making improvements. In the last two weeks we have stood up federal testing sites all over this country — and we are adding more each day. Google “COVID test near me” to find the nearest site where you can get a test."
"These coming weeks are going to be challenging. But if we all do our part, we’ll get through this."
"This afternoon, I met with members of my COVID-19 Response Team to discuss the Omicron variant and our efforts to combat it. We are working every day to increase testing capacity, get more Americans vaccinated, and support our hospitals. We will get through this, together."
Omicron is a very transmissible variant — much different than anything we’ve seen before. But you can protect yourself. Get vaccinated. Get boosted. Wear a mask while in public.
We’ve been working around the clock during the holiday weeks to: - Deploy hundreds of military doctors and nurses to staff hospitals - Work with states on their hospital capacity and provide emergency beds - Ship nearly 2.4 million pieces of protective equipment
"Today, we are doubling our Pfizer antiviral pill order from 10 million to 20 million treatment courses. These pills have been shown to dramatically decrease hospitalization and death from COVID-19. They are a game-changer."
Tune in as I give an update on our fight against COVID-19 and receive a briefing on the latest developments related to the Omicron variant.
We’re facing an inflection point with climate change and need to act. That’s why I’ve put the U.S. on course to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. The infrastructure law will help us get there by upgrading our power infrastructure and deploying cutting-edge energy technology.
"We began 2021 in the midst of an economic crisis. But because of the actions we took, we ended it with the fastest economic growth in nearly 40 years."
"As we mourn the passing of Maxine McNair, we remember those four girls taken in the horrific bombing 58 years ago. Their memories are a reminder of our work in the battle for the soul of this nation. We must continue to root out racism and stand up to hate wherever it’s found."
"In too many industries, a handful of giant companies dominate the market. The meat industry is a textbook example. Today, I met with independent farmers and ranchers to discuss how we’re working to level the playing field for them — while lowering prices for American families."
Get vaccinated and get boosted. It’s free. It’s convenient. It saves lives. And it’s your patriotic duty.
Tune in as I meet with both independent and family farmers and ranchers to discuss our work to boost competition and reduce prices in the meat-processing industry.
"We’ve added more than 300,000 U.S. manufacturing jobs since I took office, and we’re going to keep at it. Because more of what we buy in America should be made in America."
"Right now, 400,000 schools and child care centers are at risk of exposure to lead in their water. It’s unacceptable. We’re replacing 100% of the nation’s lead pipes so that every child in America can turn on the faucet and drink clean water."
Commander enjoyed his first trip to the beach.
"As I reflect on 2021, I’ve never been more optimistic about the future of this country. With hope and unity, let us come together and build on our progress in the year ahead."
"Happy New Year, folks!"
Betty White brought a smile to the lips of generations of Americans. She’s a cultural icon who will be sorely missed. Jill and I are thinking of her family and all those who loved her this New Year’s Eve.
"As we head into 2022, I want folks to remember: There’s not a single thing America cannot do when we do it together."
"When I came into office, our economy was in crisis. But over the last 11 months, we’ve added nearly 6 million jobs. That’s the largest increase in recorded history."
"Last year at this time, there were 823,000 Americans filing new jobless claims each week. This last week, that number was less than 200,000. That’s historic progress."
"Today, I committed $137 million to expanding the production of COVID-19 at-home tests using our military authority in order to meet demand."
We’re ending 2021 with what one analyst described as the strongest first-year economic track record of any president in the last 50 years. Let’s keep the progress going.
The economy I inherited nearly a year ago wasn’t just in crisis — it wasn’t working for working people. We passed the American Rescue Plan and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to help change that. We’re rebuilding our economy from the bottom up and middle out — not the top down.
"With the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we’re bringing affordable, high-speed internet to every single American."
"A son of Searchlight, Nevada, Harry never forgot his humble roots. A boxer, he never gave up a fight. A great American, he looked at challenges and believed it was within our capacity to do good — to do right. May God bless Harry Reid, a dear friend and a giant of our history."
Here’s where we stand one year in: - Nearly 6 million new jobs — a record for a new president - Unemployment down to 4.2% — three years ahead of predictions - Applications for new small businesses up 30% - The fastest economic growth in nearly 40 years America is on the move.
"COVID-19 booster shots increase antibody levels by more than 20x — providing a high degree of protection against severe illness with Omicron. Get your shot today, folks."
"My Administration has the back of every governor fighting COVID-19 in their state. Last week, I rolled out a federal plan to tackle Omicron by adding vaccination and booster capacity, hospital equipment, staff, and more. We’re going to get through this by working together."
"Folks, if you traveled for the holidays you probably saw America’s crumbling roads and bridges firsthand. We’re changing that with the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law — investing in America and creating millions of good-paying, union jobs at the same time."
"I know folks are worried about Omicron and wondering how they can stay safe. The answer is simple: Get your booster shot, get vaccinated, and wear a mask."
Tune in as I join the White House COVID-19 Response Team and the National Governors Association to discuss our Administration’s response to the Omicron variant and to hear from the Governors on the needs in their states.
"When I took office, our economy was on the brink of collapse. Now, Americans have more money in their pockets than before the pandemic, and retail sales were up 8.5% compared to last holiday season."
"Today, we are heartbroken to learn of the passing of a true servant of God and of the people, Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa. We send our deepest condolences to the people of South Africa who are mourning this great loss."
"As we begin the seven days of Kwanzaa, Jill and I send our best wishes to everyone celebrating. May this time of reflection on the rich heritage of African American culture bring peace, unity, and joy."
"Congratulations and all who made today’s launch of the James Webb telescope possible. Webb is a shining example of the power of what we can accomplish when we dream big. We've always known that this project would be a risky endeavor, but with big risk comes big rewards."
"Jill and I know how hard it is for our troops and their families to be apart during this season of togetherness. So today, we wanted to take the opportunity to say thank you. We’re grateful for all they do to make our freedom, security, and prosperity possible."
Join me as the First Lady and I meet virtually with service members to celebrate the holiday.
"From our family to yours, Merry Christmas! May your time with loved ones be filled with warmth, comfort, and joy this holiday season."
"This morning, the First Lady and I stopped by the Children’s National Hospital to spread a little holiday cheer. We hope everyone has a happy, healthy, and safe holiday season."
"I had the honor of hosting the 2021 Kennedy Center Honorees this month at the White House. These folks are giants of the arts, and I’m grateful they’ve shared their gifts with the nation and with the world."
"Today, I signed the Accelerating Access to Critical Therapies for ALS Act. Thanks to a movement led by patients and caregivers and bipartisan members of Congress, we are finally closer than ever to new treatments, and hopefully a cure."
Tune in as I sign the Accelerating Access to Critical Therapies for ALS Act into law.
"Today, I signed the bipartisan Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act. The United States will continue to use every tool at our disposal to ensure supply chains are free from the use of forced labor — including from Xinjiang and other parts of China."
"People with a booster shot are highly protected. If it’s been six months since your second shot, get your booster shot today."
"We should all be concerned about Omicron, but not panicked. If you’re fully vaccinated — and especially if you got boosted — you’re highly protected. But if you’re unvaccinated, you’re at higher risk of getting severely ill from COVID-19, getting hospitalized, and dying."
"This morning, I brought together my Supply Chain Task Force and business leaders for another progress update. My Administration is working every day to move goods faster, keep shelves stocked, and lower prices for Americans."
"We received good news today in our fight against COVID-19. The FDA granted emergency use authorization of the Pfizer antiviral pill, a promising new treatment option that will significantly reduce hospitalization and death as we battle the more transmissible Omicron variant."
"As we mark the 50th anniversary of the National Cancer Act, I call upon all Americans to reaffirm our commitment to accelerate cancer research and deliver hope to more families facing a cancer diagnosis. Working together, we can and will end cancer as we know it."
"If you and those you celebrate with are vaccinated — particularly if you’ve been boosted — and follow the precautions that we all know well, you should feel comfortable celebrating the holidays as you planned. You have done the right thing — you should enjoy the holiday season."
"Three weeks ago, I laid out our COVID-19 Action Plan for the winter that prepared us for this moment. Yesterday, I announced how we’re making the plan even stronger:"
"Today, I announced my Administration is extending the pause on federal student loan repayments for an additional 90 days."
My full statement:
"Today, my Administration is extending the pause on federal student loan repayments for an additional 90 days — through May 1, 2022 — as we manage the ongoing pandemic and further strengthen our economic recovery."
Americans who haven’t yet renewed their coverage or shopped for a plan can still visit through January 15th to sign up.
"As 2021 draws to a close, I am proud to say that more than 4.6 million Americans have gained health coverage through the Affordable Care Act since I took office. From November 1st to December 15th alone, more than 13.6 million Americans signed up — an all-time high."
"While we know staffing is the biggest need of our hospitals, some may need more beds as well. We’re prepared. I directed FEMA to activate the National Response Center and to begin deploying teams now to build more hospital beds."
"My Administration has stockpiled millions of gowns, gloves, masks, and ventilators. We are ready to send them immediately to any state that needs more. I have also directed the Pentagon to mobilize an additional 1,000 troops to help staff local hospitals and expand capacity."
We’re purchasing 500 million at-home rapid COVID tests that will be distributed for free to Americans who want them.
"To those people who have not been vaccinated: you have an obligation to yourself, your family, and your country. Get vaccinated now. It’s free. It’s convenient. It saves lives. And it’s your patriotic duty."
"Starting this week, the federal government will set up emergency testing sites in areas that need additional testing capacity. Before Christmas, the first several of these federal testing sites will be up and running in New York City — with many more to come."
This is not March 2020. 200 million people are fully vaccinated. We’re prepared. We know more. We just have to stay focused.
"Today, I am ordering the federal government to purchase half a billion additional at-home rapid tests with delivery starting in January. We will be getting these tests to Americans for free — and we will have a website where you can get them delivered to your home."
"Starting this week, I will be deploying hundreds more vaccinators and more sites to help get more booster shots in arms. I’ve ordered FEMA to stand up new pop-up vaccination clinics across the country where you can get a booster shot."
Tune in as I deliver remarks on the status of the country’s fight against COVID-19.
My Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America. We’re going to finally build the economy from the bottom up and middle out — not the top down.
"We’re not only rebuilding America’s infrastructure — we’re creating millions of good-paying, union jobs in the process."
"We are working around the clock to increase testing capacity, vaccine availability, and support for our hospitals. I'll have more to say on this tomorrow. In the meantime: Get vaccinated, get boosted, wear a mask. And keep the faith. We’ll get through this together."
"4. To our frontline workers, I am in awe of your sacrifices. Thank you for the work you are putting in on this wave after a painful and difficult two years. We owe you a tremendous debt. I am once again asking for your strength, and I’ll never forget it."
"3. We still need to take precautions and remain vigilant. Listen to the advice from doctors: even if you’re fully vaccinated, you should wear a mask when indoors in a public setting. It will help protect you and others—especially kids under 5 who can’t get vaccinated yet."
"2. Omicron cases will increase in the coming days—even among fully vaccinated individuals. If you’re vaccinated and boosted, you may still get a breakthrough case but doctors say you will likely have no symptoms or mild ones."
"1. We know that vaccines are working. If you are boosted with Pfizer or Moderna, you have a high degree of protection against severe illness with Omicron. If you’re an adult choosing to be unvaccinated, you will face an extremely difficult winter for your family and community."
"Folks, Omicron cases are on the rise in the United States. I want to give you all a sense of where we are and what we know."
"Happy 2nd birthday, !"
Meet the newest Biden.
"Welcome to the White House, Commander."
My Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will make high-speed internet affordable and available everywhere in America — and create jobs laying down broadband lines.
"Last week, I awarded the Medal of Honor to three outstanding soldiers. Their actions embody the highest ideals of selfless service."
"Right now, there’s a kid out there whose family can’t afford her insulin because it costs $1,000 per month. The Build Back Better Act would cap their monthly insulin costs at $35. I’m committed as ever to getting it done for them."
No class gets to choose the world into which they graduate. But few classes enter at a point in history where they actually have a chance to change the trajectory of the country. We face an inflection point today. And I’m confident the class of 2021 will meet the moment.
"Since I took office, nearly 6 million jobs have been created, over 200 million Americans are fully vaccinated, and unemployment claims are the lowest on average since 1969. These things didn’t happen by accident — they’re because of the American Rescue Plan."
Every kid in America should be able to turn on the faucet and drink clean water. My Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is going to make that a reality.
"In my first year in office, we’ve passed two of the most important pieces of economic legislation in decades. The third is in its final stages — and I’m confident we’ll get it passed."
Tune in as I deliver remarks at South Carolina State University’s 2021 Fall Commencement Ceremony.
We will heal. We will recover. And we will rebuild — together.
"It was my great honor to award the Medal of Honor to Sergeant First Class Alwyn Cashe, Sergeant First Class Christopher Celiz, and Master Sergeant Earl Plumlee. We must never forget their unparalleled courage or the sacrifices they made in service of our nation."
"We will – we must – get Build Back Better passed, even in the face of Republican opposition."
I had a productive call with the Speaker and the Majority Leader today. My team and I are having ongoing discussions with Senator Manchin; that work will continue next week. Leader Schumer and I are determined to see the bill successfully on the floor as early as possible.
One of the reasons I believe so firmly in my Build Back Better Act is because I know what this country can be. We have always been a nation of possibilities. We didn’t become this nation we know by dreaming small. Let’s get this passed.
Join me as I award the Medal of Honor to three American soldiers and deliver remarks.
"Today, I signed a bill raising our debt ceiling. Members of both parties came together to ensure that the federal government doesn’t default on past debts. Defaulting would be a catastrophe for our economy, and it’s a responsibility of governing to make sure we pay what we owe."
"The best protection against Omicron is getting fully vaccinated. If you haven’t gotten the shot yet, now is the time. If you’re over 16 and got vaccinated at least 6 months ago, go get your booster. Head to to find a clinic near you."
"This afternoon, I will award the Medal of Honor, our nation’s highest military honor to three American soldiers. I am honored to recognize the heroism of Sergeant First Class Alwyn C. Cashe, Sergeant First Class Christopher A. Celiz, and Master Sergeant Earl D. Plumlee."
"The average number of Americans filing for unemployment over the last four weeks is now at its lowest level since 1969. When I took office, over 18 million were receiving unemployment benefits, today only 2 million are. America is on the move again."
"My message to the people affected by this weekend’s storms is this: I intend to do whatever it takes, for as long as it takes, to support your state as you recover and rebuild."
"As I said today in Kentucky: We are all in this together, no red states or blue states, just Americans helping each other get through tough times. We’ll heal. We’ll recover. We’ll rebuild — stronger than before. And we’ll do it together. Keep the faith, and stay strong."
"Yesterday, I approved an emergency declaration for Illinois and Tennessee, in addition to Kentucky, making Federal assistance immediately available to support the response in those states."
"There have been 74 confirmed fatalities in Kentucky, at least 14 people are confirmed dead in other states, and dozens are still missing. To those who have lost someone, there are no words to ease the pain of losing a loved one. Jill and I are keeping you in our prayers."
Tune in as I deliver remarks in Kentucky on our response to the tornadoes and extreme weather.
"Recovery in Kentucky is going to take a long time, but we’ll be there every step of the way. FEMA has opened Disaster Recovery Centers and has teams on the ground. If you live in the affected areas you can also visit or call 1-800-621-3362."
"I’m going to make sure the federal government does what’s needed to be done in Kentucky. So far, we’ve sent 61 generators, provided 144,000 liters of drinking water and 74,000 meals, and thousands of cots and blankets."
"New data shows that our vaccines are effective against Omicron, especially once you get your booster. This is great news — we have the vaccines we need to protect people from the Omicron variant. Get fully vaccinated — and get your booster shot today."
"Yesterday, I met with 10 newly-elected bipartisan mayors from across the country to discuss the American Rescue Plan, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and more. The country’s mayors and local elected officials are crucial partners when it comes to building back better."
"I’m in Kentucky today to meet with local leaders and to survey the damage from the tornadoes and extreme weather. It will take all of us, working together, to recover and begin rebuilding — and we are committed to providing whatever support is needed for however long it takes."
"RT : You heard, – get covered today at"
"Today is the last day to sign up for health insurance and have coverage starting on January 1! Sign up at today, folks."
"As we mark 800,000 American deaths due to COVID-19, we must remember all those we have lost — and pray for their loved ones, especially during this holiday season. Please, get vaccinated and get your booster. We will beat COVID-19 and move forward, together, as one nation."
Hailey is proof that you can make a positive impact no matter what your age. Way to get out the word about vaccines!
Why didn’t you call me?
"We’re making progress on bringing gas prices down, and won’t stop working to get this done for the American people."
"It’s time to build on the success we’ve had this year on jobs, wages, small businesses, and fixing challenges in our economy. We need to cut costs further for families. That’s what my Build Back Better Act does."
"Nine years ago today, we lost 20 precious first-graders and six heroic educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School. As a nation, we owe the families of Newtown — and all the other victims of gun violence — more than our prayers. We owe them action."
"My Build Back Better Act would mean $7,400 in tax cuts and savings for a typical family of four with two kids."
Congratulations to for winning the MLS Cup! Your team was a reminder to always keep the faith — especially when folks count you out and write you off. I hope to see you soon.
The federal government will do everything it can to help those impacted by this weekend’s storms.
"From renewing passports to claiming retirement benefits, Americans expect government to be responsive to their needs. But too often, the experience falls short. That’s why today, I signed an Executive Order to improve government’s service delivery to the American people."
"Today, I was briefed by FEMA on our response to the tornadoes and extreme weather that impacted multiple states this weekend. We’re in close contact with officials on the ground and working to quickly get federal assistance to those in need. We will get through this together."
"Happy Birthday, !"
I’m determined to pass my Build Back Better Act and ensure Sa’Ra – and millions others – don’t pay more than $35 a month for insulin. As I told her: Keep the faith. We’re going to get this done.
The music world has lost an icon. The music of Vicente Fernández created memories for millions. We send our condolences to his family and all those who loved him. Vicente will be remembered for generations to come.
"Thanks to my American Rescue Plan, we’re cutting child poverty in America by more than 40 percent. Millions of children who spent last Christmas in poverty will not bear that burden this holiday season."
"I believe that together, the world’s democracies will lead the march of human progress and freedom forward."
"Lowering the costs of child care, elder care, housing, health care, prescription drugs — and meeting the moment on climate change. That’s what my Build Back Better Act does."
Join me as I give remarks on our response to last night’s devastating storms.
"This morning, I was briefed on the devastating tornadoes across the central U.S. To lose a loved one in a storm like this is an unimaginable tragedy. We’re working with Governors to ensure they have what they need as the search for survivors and damage assessments continue."
"The United States pays its debts when they are due. That’s why today, I signed a bill to fast-track the process to raise our debt limit."
Every employee has the right to collectively bargain. Full stop.
I am deeply troubled by reports of Kellogg’s plans to permanently replace striking workers. Permanently replacing striking workers is an existential attack on the union and its members’ jobs and livelihoods. I strongly support legislation that would ban that practice.
"Today, I spoke with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to congratulate him on his appointment. I look forward to working closely together on the full range of global challenges, including transatlantic efforts to address Russia’s destabilizing military buildup along Ukraine’s border."
I just signed a bill to fast-track the process to raise our debt limit. The nation’s full faith and credit has always been a shared responsibility. The bipartisan support of this legislation shows that it is still possible for leaders to work across the aisle and deliver.
The middle class built this country — and unions built the middle class.
Tune in as I deliver closing remarks at the virtual Summit for Democracy.
"‘Tis the season (to get boosted). See you soon, !"
"Bob Dole was an American statesman like few in our history. A war hero and among the greatest of the Greatest Generation. And to me, a friend. I will miss him. But I am grateful for the times we shared, and for the friendships built between our two families."
"Together, we’re going to build a better America."
We’re going to rebuild the economy from the bottom up and the middle out. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is a blue collar blueprint to rebuild America.
"We’re going to reinvest in our country and our people, reclaim our leadership, and create millions of jobs by building a better America."
"Two weeks ago, I announced new actions to help bring down gas prices. I was in Kansas City yesterday, where the average price of gas is down 20 cents compared to a month ago. Nationally, prices are down 7 cents and falling. We’re making progress, and we’re going to keep at it."
"Today, I'm hosting the first Summit for Democracy. We're bringing together leaders from over 100 governments, alongside activists, trade unionists, experts, and other members of civil society to lock arms and reaffirm our shared commitment to make our democracies better."
RT : President Biden is delivering the fastest economic recovery in history. Some quick facts from :
Our jobs recovery is one of the strongest ever.
New unemployment claims fell to their lowest level in more than 50 years. That’s not an accident – it’s a result of my economic plan.
"Around the world, more than ever, democracy needs champions. With each new generation, we must work to ensure that democracies can deliver for their people."
"200 million Americans are now fully vaccinated. If you haven’t already, get vaccinated and get boosted."
Tune in as I deliver opening remarks at the virtual Summit for Democracy.
We’re going to create millions of jobs building a better America — an America with the best infrastructure in the world.
"Today, I signed an executive order directing the federal government to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050."
Rebuilding America. Investing in America. Building a Better America. That’s what my Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is all about.
Tune in as I deliver remarks on the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.
Congratulations to Germany’s new Chancellor Olaf Scholz. I look forward to building on the strong ties between our two countries and working closely together to make progress on today’s global challenges.
"I’m on my way to Missouri to lay out how the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will transform our nation’s infrastructure and create good-paying, union jobs. See you soon, Kansas City!"
The new data from Pfizer on vaccine effectiveness against Omicron is encouraging. This reinforces what my medical advisors have been emphasizing: that boosters give you the highest protection yet. Anyone who is eligible and has not been boosted should go get a booster today.
"Electric vehicles are the future. With my Build Back Better Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we're going to create jobs, boost manufacturing here in the U.S., and create consumer rebates for folks to buy American-made, union-made electric vehicles."
"Since I took office in January, we’ve had the fastest drop in unemployment in a single year — and the most jobs added in the first 11 months of a year. America is on the move once again."
Nobody has held prescription drug companies accountable. Until now.
"Get your booster shot, folks."
"December 7, 1941, is a day that lives in infamy 80 years later. We will never forget those who perished at Pearl Harbor."
"As we mark National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day, we honor the patriots who perished, commemorate the valor of all those who defended our nation, and recommit ourselves to carrying forth the ensuing peace and reconciliation that brought a better future for our world."
"Right now, Americans pay as much as $1,000 a month for insulin. Under my Build Back Better Act it'll be $35."
I’ve already taken two significant steps to lower prescription drug prices: I signed an Executive Order that will improve competition — which will result in lower costs. And I’ve ordered the FDA to work with states and Tribes to import prescription drugs safely from Canada.
Prescription drug prices aren’t a partisan issue. This is about whether or not you and your loved ones can afford the prescription drugs you need. We need Congress to get this done and lower costs — to come together and make a difference in people’s lives.
"Third, we’re going to end the days where drug companies could increase their prices with no oversight. Going forward, those that increase their prices faster than inflation will face a steep excise tax. They will be held accountable when they raise prices on the American people."
"Second, for people with diabetes who don’t have health insurance today, we’re helping you get insurance so you can get protected with that $35 co-pay cap. People with diabetes who are uninsured today can visit to check out options."
"First, we are going to cap cost-sharing for insulin at $35 per month. Whether you get health insurance through your job, through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces, or through Medicare, nobody is going to pay more than $35 each month for insulin."
"For certain types of insulin, people can pay up to $1,000 per month. Under my Build Back Better Act, we’re going to take three key steps to lower costs and change that."
"There aren’t a lot of things that almost every American can agree on. But I think it’s safe to say that all of us can agree that prescription drugs are outrageously expensive in this country. It doesn’t need to be that way — and under my Build Back Better Act, it won’t be."
Tune in as I deliver remarks on how my Build Back Better Act will lower the costs of prescription drugs for millions of Americans.
Prescription drug companies have gotten away with charging outrageous prices for too long — and it needs to change. My Build Back Better Act will allow Medicare to negotiate prices — lowering costs across the board for Americans.

My Build Back Better Act is a direct answer to the challenge of higher prices. But don’t take it from me: 17 Nobel Prize winners in economics have written a letter affirming that this bill would reduce inflationary pressures in the economy.
America is on the move once again.
Unemployment is down to 4.2% three years faster than experts predicted. That’s the American Rescue Plan at work.

"On this International Day of Persons with Disabilities, we reaffirm our commitment to ensuring dignity, equity, and respect for all people with disabilities. As we build back better and address the challenges of this century, we will deal everybody in and bring everyone along."

"Today, we received incredible news that our unemployment rate has fallen to 4.2%. At this point in the year, we’re looking at the sharpest one year decline in unemployment ever."

"All told, in the first ten full months of my Administration, the economy has created 6 million jobs — a record for a new president. This is a significant improvement from when I took office — and a sign that we are on the right track."
Tune in as I deliver remarks on the November jobs report.
"Today, we have incredible news that our unemployment rate has fallen to 4.2% – a level experts didn’t expect us to achieve until 2024. We’ve created 588,000 jobs per month on average this year – a record. America is back to work, and our jobs recovery is going strong."

Tune in as I deliver remarks on our plan to continue the fight against COVID-19 as we enter the winter months and face the Omicron variant.
For years congressional Republicans have passed tax giveaways for the rich and new spending without even giving a thought about how to pay for it. It’s rich that they’re now concerned about the cost of my Build Back Better Act — which is fully paid for.
I have a plan to lower costs and ease inflation – my Build Back Better Act. Congressional Republicans can’t say the same.

"Every American family deserves affordable child care. The Build Back Better Act will lower child care costs, saving $5,000 per year for many American families."
"I’m happy to debate how we pay for my Build Back Better Act. Because if congressional Republicans want to argue that continuing tax cuts for big corporations and the wealthiest is more important than lowering costs for Americans, that’s an argument I’m happy to have."
My Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is about rebuilding and investing in America — and places like Dakota County Technical College are going to lead the way. I stopped by this afternoon to see how they’re training the next generation of workers to help us build back better.

The Omicron variant is a cause for concern — but not panic. We will fight this variant with science and speed — not chaos and confusion.
"To beat this pandemic, we have to vaccinate the world—and America is leading that effort. We have shipped—for free—more vaccines to other countries than all other countries combined. Over 275 million vaccines to 110 countries. Now, we need the rest of the world to step up."
It will be a few weeks before we know everything we need to know about how strongly the existing vaccines protect against the new variant. But Dr. Fauci and our medical team believe that our vaccines will continue to provide a degree of protection against severe disease.
The best protection against Omicron is getting fully vaccinated — and getting a booster shot.
"The day the World Health Organization identified the Omicron variant, I took immediate steps to restrict travel from the countries in Southern Africa. But while we know that travel restrictions can slow the spread — they cannot prevent it. We will have to face this new threat."

Small businesses are the backbone of communities across the country — and it’s crucial we support them during the holiday season and all year round. Shop small.
For the world community: this news is a reminder that this pandemic will not end until we have global vaccinations. The U.S. has already donated more vaccines to other countries than every other country combined. It is time for other countries to match our speed and generosity.
"As we move forward, we will continue to be guided by what the science and my medical team advises. For now the best way to strengthen your protection if you’re already vaccinated is to get a booster shot, immediately. For those not yet fully vaccinated: get vaccinated today."

From the Biden family to yours – Happy Thanksgiving.
We have a lot to be thankful for this holiday season. And I couldn’t be more grateful to serve as your president.
We have made historic progress in the ten months I’ve been in office. Unemployment is down to 4.6 percent – two years faster than experts predicted. Wages are rising. Disposable income is up. More people are starting small businesses than ever before.

This is a historic jobs recovery: 5.6 million jobs created since I took office and an unemployment rate of 4.6% two full years earlier than experts predicted was possible.

My Build Back Better Act will lower costs for American families and give folks a little bit of breathing room — and it’s paid for by ensuring those at the top pay their fair share in taxes. Let’s get this passed.
I’m tired of trickle-down economics. My Build Back Better Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal will help us build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out.
"Under my predecessor, infrastructure week was an empty promise. Now, we’re going to make an infrastructure decade a reality."
"Along with the other plans I am advancing, the infrastructure bill will reduce costs, keep our shelves fully stocked, and get people back to work. Helping us build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out that makes everyone better off."

"Yesterday, 22m couldn’t make it so _An34 had me give him a call."
The truth is America’s public transit infrastructure is inadequate. The infrastructure deal will make the largest investment in public transit in our nation’s history — helping make daily commutes more reliable and more efficient.
"If you look around on your daily commute, it’s no secret that 1 in 5 miles of our highways and major roads — and 45,000 of our bridges — are in poor condition. My Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal is going to repair and rebuild them. It’ll be a game changer for the country."
"Clean drinking water for every American. High-speed internet for every American. Better roads and bridges for every American. A brighter, cleaner future for every American. That’s my Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal."

In sports — as in a democracy — unity is perhaps the most elusive and necessary of things. But that’s who the Milwaukee are — united. And a powerful example on and off the court. I was honored to host them at the White House today to celebrate their 2021 NBA Championship.
"It’s simply unacceptable that we’ve fallen behind on infrastructure, education, and more. With my Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal and Build Back Better Act, we’re finally turning that around."

Tune in as we welcome the Milwaukee Bucks to the White House to celebrate their 2021 NBA Championship.
"After months of negotiations, we reached a deal on prescription drug prices last week. It’s going to lower prices for folks like Gail and make a real difference in the lives of Americans across the country."
"This afternoon, I’m hosting the Milwaukee Bucks at the White House. I’m looking forward to celebrating their 2021 NBA Championship and their work off the court to move our nation forward."
"My Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal will build a national network of charging stations for electric vehicles and thousands of miles of new, resilient transmission lines for a clean energy grid. Together with the Build Back Better Framework, it will help tackle the climate crisis."
"Good on ya, . Getting vaccinated is the best way to keep your whole neighborhood safe."
We’re finally going to get rid of our nation’s dangerous lead pipes thanks to this infrastructure deal. Every kid in this country will be able to turn on the tap and drink clean water.
"My Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal is going to modernize our ports, airports, and freight rail – making it easier for companies to get goods to market more quickly and reduce supply chains’ bottlenecks now and for decades to come."
"This week, we learned that our economy created 5.6 million jobs since I took office, and unemployment is down to 4.6% two years faster than predicted. With this economic progress, the infrastructure deal, and my Build Back Better Act – we’ll win the 21st century."
"This infrastructure deal is something that has been talked about in Washington for so long, but never done – until now. It is a game changer in so many ways for Americans."
The vast majority of the jobs created by my Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal don’t require a college degree. This is a blue-collar blueprint for our country.
My two bills – the Build Back Better Framework and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal – add up to the largest effort to combat climate change in the history of the United States of America.
It’s time to begin rebuilding America.
These investments are a huge deal for the American people. Take it from a guy who likes trains almost as much as I do:
"The Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal will create good-paying, union jobs and transform our transportation system with the most significant investments in passenger rail in 50 years, in roads and bridges in 70 years, and in public transit ever."
This Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal creates jobs replacing lead water pipes so every American can drink clean water. And jobs making high-speed internet available everywhere in America so no parent has to sit in a parking lot so their child can access the internet for homework.
. and I look forward to having a formal signing ceremony of this bipartisan infrastructure legislation soon. But I’m looking more forward to having shovels in the ground.
"The Build Back Better Act will ease the cost of child and elder care, provide universal preschool, lower prescription drug and health care costs, and cut taxes for the middle class. Let me be clear: we will pass this bill in the House and then we will pass it in the Senate."
"Last night, the House of Representatives passed my Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal – a once-in-a-generation investment that will create millions of jobs modernizing our infrastructure, turn the climate crisis into an opportunity, and put us on a path to win the 21st century."
Tune in as I deliver remarks on the House of Representative’s passage of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal.
We’ve just taken a monumental step forward as a nation.
"I am urging all members to vote for both the rule for consideration of the Build Back Better Act and final passage of the Bipartisan Infrastructure bill tonight. I am confident that during the week of November 15, the House will pass the Build Back Better Act."
"Thanks to the economic plan that I got through Congress earlier this year and our successful vaccine deployment, we’re adding jobs at a record pace."
"We laid the foundation for the progress we’re seeing today with my American Rescue Plan. It put money in working families’ pockets, helped keep small businesses going, and vaccinated millions. We're moving in the right direction, now it's time to build back better."
"I want to say very clearly: If your number one issue is the cost of living, the number one priority should be seeing Congress pass the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal and my Build Back Better Framework."
"Today is another great day in our economic recovery. Thanks to the economic plan that I got through Congress earlier this year and our successful vaccine deployment, America continues to add jobs at a record pace. Our economy is on the move."
Tune in as I deliver remarks on the October jobs report.
"Over 5.6 million jobs created. Under 5% unemployment. This is a significant improvement from when I took office, and a sign that we are on the right track."
"Those at the top have gotten a free ride — at the expense of the middle class — for far too long. My Build Back Better Framework will make the super-wealthy and big corporations pay their fair share, and then invest that money in the middle class."
Initial unemployment insurance claims are down by nearly two-thirds since when I took office. This is real progress – and we’re not slowing down.
No one should have to choose between paying for lifesaving medication or putting food on the table. My Build Back Better Framework will help lower prescription drug costs for Americans.
"Today, the Labor Department issued its rule requiring COVID-19 vaccinations for companies with 100 or more employees and HHS released its rule to ensure that health care workers are vaccinated. Together, they will cover about 100 million Americans and help us beat COVID-19."
"May the light of Diwali remind us that from darkness there is knowledge, wisdom, and truth. From division, unity. From despair, hope. To Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, and Buddhists celebrating in America and around the world — from the People’s House to yours, happy Diwali."
"Please, get your kids vaccinated. It’s safe and effective — and the best way to put this pandemic behind us."
"We have made incredible progress on COVID-19 over these past nine months. But we have to keep going. So please, do your part. Get vaccinated."
"Today, once again, Senate Republicans blocked debate on the bipartisan John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. Provisions in the bill have passed the Senate with overwhelming bipartisan support five times. Let there be a debate and a vote."
"To parents and guardians of children ages 5 and older: please get them vaccinated. Children make up almost one quarter of cases in this country. The vaccine will help protect them and others, help stop the spread, and help us beat this pandemic."
Tune in as I deliver remarks on the authorization of the COVID-19 vaccine for kids ages 5 to 11.
The vaccine is safe and effective and is the best way to protect kids from COVID-19 — including the Delta variant. Let’s build on the extraordinary progress we’ve made over the last nine months and put this pandemic behind us once and for all.
"The program will ramp up over the coming days, and be fully up and running next week. Parents will be able to bring their children to one of tens of thousands of locations including pharmacies, pediatricians’ offices, schools, and other sites to get vaccinated."
My Administration has been working hard to be prepared for this moment — and we are ready to act. We’ve secured enough supply for every child in America — and have begun distributing pediatric vaccine doses to thousands of locations across the country.
"We have reached a turning point in our battle against COVID-19: authorization of a safe, effective vaccine for children age 5-11. It will allow parents to end months of anxious worrying about their kids — and is a major step forward in our fight to defeat the virus."
"I left COP26 today feeling as optimistic as I ever have about our path forward on climate. We’re leading the way, and we’re going to get this done."
"Today, following a rigorous review and authorization process by the FDA, the CDC has formally recommended the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine for children 5-11. This is encouraging news, and a major step forward for our nation in our fight to defeat the virus."
We’ve reached a deal on prescription drug prices. Read more about how this lowers drug costs:
Tune in as I hold a press conference from COP26 in Glasgow.
There’s no more time to waste when it comes to combating climate change. Let this be the moment we answer history’s call. Let COP26 be the start of a decade of transformative action that preserves our planet and raises the quality of life for people everywhere. We can do this.
"The Build Back Better World infrastructure initiative is going to show that we can grow our economies, fight climate change, and leave a better, cleaner, more livable planet for our children. Let’s get to work."
"My Administration is working overtime to show that our climate commitment is about action — not words. That’s why on my very first day in office, I took action to rejoin the Paris Agreement. And we’ve been continuing our work every day since."
"Because of the action we’re taking, the United States will be able to meet the ambitious target I set to reduce our emissions by 50% below 2005 levels by 2030. The world sees that we’re not only back at the table, we’re leading by the power of our example."
My Build Back Better Framework will make a historic investment in clean energy — the most significant investment to deal with the climate crisis that any advanced nation has made. Ever.
The science is clear: We have only a brief window to raise our ambition and rise to meet the threat of climate change. We can do it if the world comes together with determination and ambition. That’s what COP26 is about — and that’s the case I made today in Glasgow.
This is the decisive decade in which to prove ourselves. We can keep the goal of limiting global warming to just 1.5 degrees Celsius within our reach — if we come together.
"There’s no substitute for face-to-face diplomacy. I’m here at COP26 to make sure that we meet the moment on climate, and kick off a decade of ambition, action, and innovation to preserve our shared future."
It isn’t just our moral obligation to combat climate change — it’s an economic imperative. The future will belong to those who act now to harness the power of a clean energy economy.
I had a great meeting with President Joko Widodo of Indonesia this afternoon. We’re committed to strengthening the partnership between our two nations — and I look forward to the work ahead under Indonesia’s forthcoming G20 Presidency.
Climate change is already ravaging our world. It’s not a hypothetical threat — it’s destroying people’s lives and livelihoods every day. We have to act.
"Today, I’m in Glasgow to kick off COP26. Climate change is the challenge of our collective lifetimes — the existential threat to human existence as we know it. And every day we delay, the cost of inaction increases. Let this be the moment that we answer history’s call."
"Health care should be a right — not a privilege. And with the beginning of the open enrollment period today, we can continue delivering on that promise. Signing up is easy — simply go to and select the plan that works best for you and your family."

"My plans are not about left versus right — or moderate versus progressive — or anything else that pits Americans against one another. They are about competitiveness, expanding opportunity, and leading the world."
"It was an honor to meet with Pope Francis again at the Vatican yesterday. His compassion and advocacy for the poor and those suffering from hunger, conflict, and persecution serves as a North Star for the world. May we all carry his example with us as we go about our daily lives."
"Here at the G20, leaders representing 80% of the world’s GDP – allies and competitors alike – made clear their support for a strong global minimum tax. This is more than just a tax deal – it’s diplomacy reshaping our global economy and delivering for our people."
"Day one of the G20, working with world leaders on our shared interests — from the global pandemic and our global recovery, to confronting the climate crisis, and a host of other issues that matter to the American people."
I had a productive first day of meetings in Rome. Looking forward to the start of the G20 tomorrow.

My plans are fiscally responsible. They are fully paid for. They don’t add a single penny to the deficit.
"If you look at the history of the journey of this nation, what becomes clear is this: Given half a chance, the American people have never let this nation down. So let’s get this done. Let’s pass these bills."
"I had a great meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron this afternoon. The United States has no older, no more loyal, no more decent ally than France. They’ve been with us from the beginning — and we will always be there for them."
I met with Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi today to thank him for his leadership of the G20 during a year of overlapping global challenges. We recognized the historic achievement of a global minimum tax and the commitment to rapidly decarbonize how we produce electricity.
"It was an honor to meet with Pope Francis again at the Vatican today. I thanked His Holiness for his advocacy for the world’s poor and those suffering from hunger, conflict, and persecution, and lauded his leadership in fighting the climate crisis and ending the pandemic."
The framework will achieve over a billion metric tons of emissions reductions. That’s at least 10 times bigger on climate than any bill that’s ever passed before.
We cannot be competitive in the 21st century global economy if we continue to slide. That’s why I’ve said all along that we need to build America from the bottom up and the middle out. Not from the top down — with more trickle-down economics that has always failed us.
The Build Back Better Framework is going to rebuild the middle class.
My Build Back Better Framework includes a $100 billion investment to improve our immigration system. I’ve committed since the beginning to ensuring that immigration is a part of Build Back Better — and I’m honoring that commitment.
Next stop: Rome.
"The framework also makes the most significant investment to deal with the climate crisis — ever — beyond any other advanced nation in the world. And we’ll do it in a way that grows domestic industries, creates good-paying union jobs, and addresses environmental injustice."
"The framework extends tax credits to lower premiums for folks on the Affordable Care Act for another three years. And, Medicare will now cover the cost of hearing aids and services."
"With the framework, we are going to make sure every 3-and 4-year old child in America will go to high quality preschool. This will take us from 12 years to 14 years of universal education in America."
We’ll also extend the historic middle-class tax cut for parents — the expanded Child Tax Credit — we passed through the American Rescue Plan. The framework will make it permanently refundable — making sure that the families who need it most get the full credit.
"A typical family spends $11,000 a year on child care — in many states it’s more than that. With the framework, we are going to make sure nearly all working families earning less than $300,000 a year will not pay more than 7% of their income on child care."
"About 820,000 seniors and people with disabilities are on a Medicaid waiting list right now to get home care. The framework will expand services for seniors, so that families can get help from well-trained, well-paid professionals."
Today — with my Democratic colleagues — we have a framework for my Build Back Better plan. Here’s how it will fundamentally change the lives of millions of people for the better:
This framework includes historic investments in our nation and our people. Any single element in the framework would be a fundamental change in America. Taken together they are truly consequential.
"RT : After months of tough and thoughtful negotiations, President Biden has announced a historic economic framework. Here’s what…"
The framework will: - Create millions of jobs - Grow the economy - Invest in our nation and our people - Turn the climate crisis into an opportunity - Put us on a path to win the economic competition for the 21st century against China and the rest of the world
Join me as I give an update on the historic Build Back Better Framework.
I ran for president saying it was time to rebuild the backbone of this nation – the middle class. That’s exactly what my Build Back Better Framework is going to do.

Universal preschool. Historic climate investments. Lower health care costs. They’re all within our reach. Let’s bring these bills over the finish line.
"With the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal, we’re going to: - Make the largest investment in public transit in American history - Make high-speed internet affordable and available everywhere - Strengthen our infrastructure against the impacts of climate change"
My Build Back Better Agenda and Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal are once-in-a-generation investments that will transform the lives of families across this country. We have to get this done.
"High-speed internet is essential in the 21st century, but too many Americans lack access to it. With the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal, we’re going to change that."
"Three years ago, a lone gunman took 11 lives at the Tree of Life Synagogue. It was the deadliest act of antisemitism in our nation's history—and a reminder that we must rally against hate in all its forms. May the memories of those who lost their lives forever be for a blessing."
"I wish all my meetings were this fun. On Monday, I got to see firsthand the type of high quality preschool that all 3- and 4-year-olds would have access to under my plans. Let’s get this done."
"The Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal will create good-paying, union jobs at prevailing wages."
"Every American family deserves access to high quality, affordable child care. My Build Back Better Agenda will make it a reality."
Make no mistake: Climate change is an existential threat to humanity. We need to act. We need to pass my Build Back Better Agenda.
"Under my Build Back Better Agenda, no middle class family will spend more than 7% of their income on child care. And we’re going to extend the historic middle class tax cut for parents — the expanded Child Tax Credit — we passed through the American Rescue Plan."
"When the Portal bridge was first built, it was state of the art. But that was over 110 years ago. Nowadays, it’s a chokepoint. We’re moving forward on a new bridge — and with my infrastructure bill, we’re going to make sure projects like this are just the beginning."
"Today, I participated in the annual U.S.-ASEAN Summit, where I discussed our commitment to strengthening our partnership with ASEAN. We will continue to work together to end the COVID-19 pandemic, address the climate crisis, promote economic growth, and more."
We have to once again build America from the bottom up and the middle out — not the top down.
"When we make the investments in my Build Back Better Agenda and Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal, there will be no stopping America. We will win the future."
"The existential threat to humanity is climate change. In a few days, I am headed to 26 in Glasgow to demonstrate a commitment to the world that we will get to a net-zero emissions economy no later than 2050."
We haven’t passed a transformative infrastructure bill for decades in this country. We need to get this done.
"Studies show that the earlier our children begin to learn in school, the better. That’s why we’re going to make two years of high-quality preschool available to every child. I stopped by East End Elementary School to discuss how my Build Back Better Agenda will get it done."
Tune in as I deliver remarks on my Build Back Better Agenda and Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal.
It’s simple: a teacher shouldn’t pay a higher tax rate than an oil company. That’s what I’m trying to change.
My Build Back Better Agenda will make sure all children can attend a high quality preschool.
"Today, I’m heading to New Jersey to highlight the need for my Build Back Better Agenda and Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal. This is our moment to invest in American families, revitalize our nation’s infrastructure, and win the competition for the 21st century."
My Build Back Better Agenda means free school for every 3- and 4-year-old in America. No matter their background.
"Right now, under Medicaid, there are 800,000 people who qualify for home care and don’t have it. My plans will provide the funding for Medicaid so the elderly and people with disabilities can receive professional care at home. This will make a huge difference for families."
Scranton isn’t my home because of the memories it gave me – it’s my home because of the values it gave me. Those values are at the core of my plans for this nation.
"Too many people with mental health needs feel they have nowhere to turn. Having a broken spirit is no different than having a broken arm – please, don’t be ashamed to seek the help you need."
"I promised not to raise taxes on anyone making under $400,000 a year. I’m going to keep that promise."
"I enjoyed speaking with President Macron of France today. I look forward to meeting with him in Rome later this month to continue the conversation, take stock of the many areas of U.S.-France cooperation, and reinforce our shared interests and common values."
"I’ve said it before – when I think climate, I think of jobs. We can meet the moment on climate change, and create good-paying, union jobs with my plans."
Caregiving is at the center of my Build Back Better Agenda. We’re going to cut the cost of child care for working families by half. That’s huge.
"After last night’s town hall, I had a chance to answer a few more questions from social media backstage:"
"My child tax credit is a tax cut for the middle class. Middle class Americans will get a monthly payment of $300 for a kid under the age of 6, and $250 for kids over the age of 6."
A lot of Americans are a part of the sandwich generation: you have young kids and you have aging parents. My Build Back Better Agenda will expand access to affordable home care through Medicaid and lower the price of child care.
"Under my Build Back Better Agenda, parents will not have to pay more than 7% of their income in childcare. Think of the difference this is going to make in the lives of families across the country."
We are one of the few industrial counties in the world that doesn’t have paid leave. My paid leave plan includes four weeks of federally funded leave. It’s good for businesses and it’s good for families.
"Look, we have two plans – one for our physical infrastructure and another for our human infrastructure. We need roads, highways, bridges, buses, and trains – and we need to make sure parents can afford child care, elder care. My plans get it done."
"When I ran for the presidency, I said I'm running for three reasons: To restore the soul and decency in the country. To rebuild the middle class and the working class from the middle out. And to actually unite the country. To those saying we can’t do it: I know that we can."
Compromise has become a dirty word – but bipartisan compromise is still possible. I’m going to see it through.
We need to rebuild our infrastructure and our economy to give working class people some breathing room. My plans get it done.
I’m fighting every day to pass my Build Back Better Agenda for folks like Brandon. His story is like so many I’ve heard across the country. Folks are just looking for a fighting chance and to be treated with the dignity they deserve – and that’s what my agenda is all about.
It’s always a good bet to bet on America. That’s what my Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal and Build Back Better Agenda do. They’re about betting on America. About believing in America. About believing in the American people. Let’s get this done.
Jim Crow in the 21st century is now the sinister combination of voter suppression and election subversion. It is the most un-American thing that any of us can imagine.
Today is Latina Equal Pay Day – a day to recognize that it takes American Latinas 21 months to earn what white men earn in a year. It is unacceptable. And my Administration is committed to working to close this gap.
"Under my Administration, we’ve gone from the brink of financial collapse to historic job growth. We have a lot of work to do still – but this is progress."
"To make real the full promise of America, we must protect the foundational right from which all rights flow: The sacred right to vote. It is democracy’s threshold liberty. With it — anything is possible. Without it — nothing is."
"Tune in as the Vice President and I deliver remarks at the 10th Anniversary celebration of the dedication of the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial."
"I’m heading to Baltimore today to talk about all the ways my agenda will improve things for folks in your city, the state of Maryland, and across the country. And P.S. if you see me around town today — you can always call me Joe."
"My Agenda means all 3- and 4-year-olds in Maryland will be able to attend high quality preschool. And it will cut child care costs for middle income families by half. More than 100,000 students in Maryland will get more help paying for college through an increase in Pell grants."
"It will provide high-speed internet access to the more than 147,000 people in Maryland who currently lack it. And $844 million for Maryland to improve water infrastructure for residents. No more lead pipes putting kids at risk."
"In Maryland alone, my Agenda will invest at least $4.1 billion for federal-aid highways and $409 million for bridges — plus $1.7 billion to improve public transportation options in the state."
"Baltimore — I got your note. I hear you, and I’m working on some things that I think will help."
"Happy Birthday, !"
How can we compete in the world if millions of parents can’t join the workforce because they can’t afford the cost of child care and have to stay home? My Build Back Better Agenda will ensure no middle-income family will pay more than 7% of their income on child care.
The American people spoke. My Build Back Better Agenda and Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal are what 81 million Americans voted for when they voted for me. Their voice deserves to be heard. Not denied.
"No matter how long you live there, Scranton never leaves you. So, when I ran for president, I came back and resolved to bring Scranton values to bear. To make a fundamental shift in how our economy works for working people. That’s what my Build Back Better Agenda will do."
Tune in as I deliver remarks on the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal and my Build Back Better Agenda.
The sacred right to vote is under unrelenting assault across the country — and the Senate needs to take action to protect it. Senate Republicans need to allow a debate and let there be a vote on the Freedom to Vote Act. Democracy — the very soul of America — is at stake.
"I ran on the promise of building an economy that works for the folks in Scranton — not those on Park Avenue. And, I won’t rest until the job is done."
"Here’s the deal: If you spent $3 on your coffee this morning, that’s more than what 55 major corporations paid in taxes in recent years. It’s wrong — and it’s got to change."
"Today, I’m heading back home to Scranton. It’s where my values — of hard work and treating others with dignity — were set. Those values are at the core of my agenda. See you soon, Scranton."
"Right now, workers and the ultra-wealthy aren’t just playing on an unfair playing field — they’re playing different sports. My plans will put an end to that."
The COVID-19 plan I laid out in September is working. We’re headed in the right direction. But we have critical work to do — and we can’t let up.
"The bottom line is this: When we give working families a break, we’re not just raising their quality of life. We’re also positioning our country to compete for the future."
"I’m the proud husband of an educator, and I’ve seen firsthand the dedication and selflessness the job requires. Yesterday, we hosted recipients of the 2020 and 2021 Teacher of the Year awards at the White House to celebrate their achievements and thank them for all they do."
We’re going to pass my Build Back Better Agenda and ensure the super-wealthy and big corporations pay their fair share.
"Since I took office, the economy has created nearly 5 million jobs and unemployment is the lowest it’s been since the beginning of the pandemic. Let’s pass the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal and my Build Back Better Agenda to keep this progress going."
"Despite the attacks and misinformation, my plans still have the overwhelming support of the American people. They understand that when families have a little more breathing room, America has a better shot."
"Jill and I are deeply saddened by the passing of our dear friend and a patriot of unmatched honor and dignity, General Colin Powell. Time and again, he put country before self, before party, before all else—in uniform and out. He will be remembered as one of our great Americans."
The cost of the Build Back Better Agenda — in terms of adding to the deficit — is zero. It’s paid for because big corporations and the very wealthy will start paying their fair share.
"It’s never a good bet to bet against the American people. It’s time for us to invest in ourselves to show the world that American democracy works. And that given half a chance, there’s nothing we can’t achieve if we work together."
It was an honor to welcome President Kenyatta of Kenya to the White House last week.
Met a future president last week.
"With my Build Back Better Agenda, most American families will see their child care costs cut by more than half. That will help more parents get back into the workforce and make ends meet."
It isn’t right that 55 of our largest corporations paid zero in federal income taxes on $40 billion of profits in 2020. It needs to change.
"If you look at the world’s advanced economies, they invest an average of $14,000 per year for a toddler’s child care. America spends about $500 — 28 times less than our competitors. It holds families and our economy back. My Build Back Better Agenda will change that."

Tune in as the First Lady and I honor fallen heroes at the 40th Annual National Peace Officers’ Memorial Service.
"No one making under $400,000 per year will see their taxes go up a single penny because of my Build Back Better Agenda. In fact, the plan cuts taxes for working people."
My Build Back Better Agenda and Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal are not about left versus right. They’re about leading the world or continuing to let the world pass us by.
"Our infrastructure has fallen from the best in the world to 13th. But just as importantly, America ranks 35th out of 37 major economies when it comes to investing in early childhood education and care. We cannot be competitive in the 21st century if we continue to slide."
Today was a perfect reminder of what our families need so our economy can thrive. We can’t compete in the world if millions of Americans can’t be part of the workforce because they can’t afford the cost of child care. My Build Back Better Agenda will change that.
Tune in as I deliver remarks at the dedication of the Dodd Center for Human Rights at the University of Connecticut.

"We can’t go back to the way things were before the pandemic, we have to build back better. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal and my Build Back Better Agenda will lower everyday costs and build an economy where everyone has a fair shot—not just the wealthy. Let’s get this done."
"Today, I’m heading to Hartford to highlight how my Build Back Better Agenda will invest in child care and keep costs down for working families. See you soon, Connecticut!"
"When I took office eight months ago, we inherited an economy in crisis and less than 1% of adults were vaccinated. Now, we’re creating an average of 600,000 jobs a month and nearly 80% of eligible Americans have received at least one shot. That’s progress."
We can end this pandemic. Get vaccinated.
"We’re making important progress in our fight against COVID-19, but we can’t let up now."
It was an honor to welcome President Kenyatta to the White House this afternoon. The U.S.-Kenya strategic partnership is essential to addressing key regional and global challenges — and I'm committed to further elevating our ties with Kenya and nations across Africa as a whole.
The Labor Department will soon be issuing its emergency rule for companies with 100 or more employees to implement vaccination requirements. Every day we see more businesses implementing vaccination requirements — and mounting data that shows they work.
"We’re making progress in the fight against COVID-19. Daily cases are down 47% and hospitalizations are down 38%, case rates are declining in 39 states, and we’re down to 66 million unvaccinated people. We’re in a critical period as we work to turn a corner on COVID-19."
"This afternoon, I’ll be hosting Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta for a bilateral meeting. I look forward to strengthening the relationship between our nations and ushering a new era of U.S. cooperation with the African continent based on principles of mutual respect and equality."

We’ve created nearly five million jobs since I took office in January. That’s ten times the average monthly rate I inherited from my predecessor.
My Administration will do what is needed to ensure supply chains are working for the American people.
The actions I’m taking on supply chains are aimed at making sure you have what you need – whether that’s presents that arrive on time or a kitchen appliance. We’re working around the clock to speed things up.pres

"The Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal and my Build Back Better Agenda will transform our ports, highways, and rail systems that sorely need upgrading. That would bring products faster and more efficiently from the factory to the store to your house."
We need to invest in making more of our products right here in the United States. Never again should our country — and our economy — be unable to make critical products we need because they don’t have access to the materials to make the products.
By increasing the number of late-night hours of operation — and opening up for less-crowded hours when goods can move faster — today’s announcement has the potential to be a game changer.
"Here’s why it matters: By staying open 24/7, the Port of Los Angeles will be open over 60 extra hours a week. That means an increase in the hours for workers to be moving cargo off ships and onto trucks and railcars to get to their destinations."
"After working closely with my team, the Port of Los Angeles is announcing today that it will begin operating 24 hours 7 days a week — which follows the Port of Long Beach’s commitment. A 24/7 system is what most of the leading countries operate on. Except us. Until now."
Tune in as I deliver remarks on efforts to address global transportation supply chain bottlenecks.
"Happy 246th birthday, !"
When we invest in our people and give working families a better shot — America has a better shot. That’s what my Build Back Better Agenda is all about.
Today I’m announcing that the Port of LA will begin operating around the clock 24/7 to make sure Americans can get the goods they need. My Administration is working around the clock to move more goods faster and strengthen the resiliency of our supply chains.
"It’s simple: If you’re a factory worker or a teacher or a firefighter, there’s absolutely no reason why you should be paying a higher tax rate than millionaires and billionaires. We’ve got to change that — and my Build Back Better Agenda will get it done."
"The world is watching, but as I’ve said before: It’s never been a good idea to bet against the American people. We’ve got to pass my Build Back Better Agenda, meet this moment in history, and show the world that American democracy works. We can do this."
"With my Build Back Better Agenda and Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal, we’re going to ensure America is competitive in the fast-changing 21st century global economy."
"This morning, I met virtually with G20 leaders on Afghanistan. We’re committed to working closely with the international community and using diplomatic, humanitarian, and economic means to address the situation in Afghanistan and support the Afghan people."
"We need to build an economy around the middle class — an economy that gives folks a fighting chance to get ahead, and gives our country a fighting chance to compete with the rest of the world. We can’t get there thinking small. We have to think big."
"Folks, it’s time those at the top pay their fair share."
I’ve never been more optimistic about this country than I am right now. We are going to pass both the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal and the Build Back Better Agenda – and start building this economy to beat the competition and deliver for working families.
"Despite the attacks and misinformation, my plans still have the overwhelming support of the American people. They understand what’s at stake here. They understand that when workers and families have a better shot – America has a better shot."
"If you haven’t yet — please, get vaccinated."
"We are devastated by the death of General Raymond Odierno, US Army, retired. He made our entire nation better, stronger, and more secure. We are keeping his beloved wife Linda, their children Tony, Mike, and Katie, and their grandchildren in our prayers."
It’s long past time we build a tax system that works for the middle class – not just those at the top. My Build Back Better Agenda will get it done.
"It isn’t enough just to invest in our physical infrastructure. If we’re going to lead the world, we also have to invest in our people. That’s what my Build Back Better Agenda does."

"Met another Joey this week, and as I told him: We’re going to get this pandemic under control – together."
"Thirty years ago, the US ranked 6th among advanced economies in the share of women working. Today we rank 23rd. Millions of parents are feeling the squeeze – earning a paycheck while taking care of their children or aging parents. My Build Back Better Agenda will change that."
"Today we learned that in my eight months in office, the economy has created nearly 5 million jobs — and unemployment is now the lowest it's been since March 2020. But, we have more work to do — and I’m going to keep working every day to build back better for the American people."

"This afternoon, I toured a Clayco construction site in Illinois. The company is doing something more than constructing buildings, they’re helping us beat COVID-19. I hope more companies will follow their lead and implement vaccination requirements."
A strong majority of Americans support vaccination requirements. They know this isn’t about politics. It’s about life and death. It’s about looking out for one another.
We’ve made real progress across the board since I laid out my plan to accelerate the path out of the pandemic: - More than 185 Million Americans are fully vaccinated - More than 75% of eligible Americans have gotten at least one shot - And we’re making great progress on equity
"RT : Vaccination requirements work. They drive up vaccination rates, which makes our communities and schools safer, along with s…"

I’m already setting the course for America to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. My Build Back Better Agenda will help us get there in a way that creates union jobs and makes us global leaders of clean energy industries — like electric vehicles and solar and wind power.

Republicans are playing Russian roulette with the U.S. economy for their political gain. This stunt could be catastrophic for the pocketbooks of American families.
Republican obstruction on the debt limit is putting the savings and pocketbooks of Americans on the line. Senate Republicans need to get out of the way. Read more from my advisors:

We’re facing a relentless attack on the sacred right to vote across the country — and we need to act. I am glad to see the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act introduced in the Senate to ensure every American can make their voice heard at the ballot box. I urge its passage.
I ran on my Build Back Better Agenda. I said it was time to build an economy that looks out from Scranton — instead of looking down from Wall Street. It’s what 81 million Americans — the most votes in history — were supporting when they supported me. Now it’s time to deliver.
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal and my Build Back Better Agenda are not about moderate versus progressive. These bills are about competitiveness versus complacency. Opportunity versus decay. They’re about leading the world — or continuing to let the world pass us by.
The work of our time is to prepare ourselves to be competitive — and to win — in the fast-changing 21st century global economy. That’s why we need the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal and my Build Back Better Agenda.
Tune in as I deliver remarks on the need for the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal and my Build Back Better Agenda.

Not only are Republicans refusing to do their job. They are threatening to use their power to prevent us from doing our job.
"Republicans in Congress raised the debt limit three times when Donald Trump was President — each time with Democratic support. But now they won’t raise it, even though they are responsible for it."
"To the American people, I say this: As soon as this week, your savings and your pocketbook could be directly impacted by this Republican stunt to block us from raising the debt limit. It’s flat-out dangerous. They need to stop playing Russian roulette with the U.S. economy."
"The reason we have to raise the debt limit is—in part—because of the reckless tax and spend policies of the last Administration. They incurred nearly $8 trillion in bills that we have to pay off. Now, Republicans won’t vote to raise the debt limit to cover their own spending."
"Not only are Republicans refusing to do their job to raise the debt ceiling. They are threatening to use their power to prevent us from doing our job — saving the economy from a catastrophic event. It’s hypocritical, dangerous, and disgraceful."
"Tune in as I deliver remarks on the need to raise the debt ceiling, after Republicans voted last week to default."
"The fact of the matter is my Build Back Better Agenda costs $0 — and it won’t raise taxes on anyone making under $400,000 a year. We’re going to pay for it by ensuring those at the top and big corporations pay their fair share."

Let me be clear: No hardworking American should be paying more in taxes than entire tech or oil companies. It’s long past time corporations pay their fair share.

The idea that 50 major corporations — making a total of $40 billion — pay nothing in taxes is just plain wrong.
"If you got the Pfizer vaccine in January, February, or March — and you are over 65, have a medical condition, or work in a frontline job — you can go get your booster. They will be available in 80,000 locations, including at over 40,000 pharmacies nationwide."
Tune in as I deliver remarks and receive my COVID-19 booster shot.
I’ll be getting my COVID-19 booster shot — and I encourage everyone who’s eligible to get theirs as well.
Hardworking Americans shouldn’t be paying more in taxes than giant corporations. It needs to end.

"We’re going to pass a historic middle class tax cut — and we’ll do it by making those at the top pay their fair share. I know the crowd on Park Ave might not like it, but it’s time we give people in towns like Scranton — the folks I grew up with — a break for a change."
When I think of climate change — I think jobs. These union workers are leading on the technologies that will help us lead the world and tackle the climate crisis head-on.

"As we continue our economic recovery, we have a fundamental question to answer: Are we going to continue with an economy where the rich just get richer? Or are we finally going to give working families — the folks that built this country — a leg up? I know my answer."
We can’t just build back to the way things were before the pandemic. We have to build back better. We’re building an economy where everyone has a fair shot — not just those at the top.

My Build Back Better Agenda will restore some semblance of fairness to our tax system. Because no teacher or firefighter should be paying more in taxes than an entire oil company. It’s got to change.

We need to build an economy that gives working people a fair shot. We need to restore fairness to our tax code. We need to make long overdue investments in our infrastructure. We need to pass the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal and my Build Back Better Agenda.
For me it’s pretty simple: It’s about time working people got the tax breaks in this country. That’s the Build Back Better Agenda.
"My plan is very clear: we will not raise taxes on anyone making under $400,000 a year. It’s only corporations and people making over $400,000 a year who will see their taxes go up."
Big corporations and the super wealthy have to start paying their fair share. It is long overdue.
RT : Press Sec. Jen Psaki sat down to answer your questions about the President’s Build Back Better Agenda. Here’s the topline…
"My Build Back Better Agenda benefits ordinary, hardworking Americans — not those at the top. It’s a historic middle class tax cut — cutting taxes for over 50 million families."
"We’re facing an inflection point with the climate crisis — and the time to act is now. This morning, I reconvened the Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate to discuss our progress here at home and how we can rally the world to tackle this crisis with the urgency it demands."
It’s time that working people in this country got the tax breaks for a change.
"Today in this country, the top 1% evade an estimated $160 billion in taxes each year. 55 of the most profitable corporations in America pay zero dollars in federal income taxes on $40 billion in profit. It just isn’t right — and my economic plan will change it."
"Immigrants come to America from different circumstances, but every generation has made us stronger. This Citizenship Day serves as a reminder that it’s up to us to ensure we remain a country worthy of the dreams and aspirations of immigrants from around the world."
This is our moment to prove to the American people that their government works for them – and not just big corporations and those at the top.
This is our opportunity to be the nation we know we can and should be. A nation where all of us — not just those at the top — get to share in the benefits of a growing economy in the years ahead. Let’s not squander this moment. Let’s look forward — and build back better.
I believe we’re at an inflection point. Are we going to continue with an economy where the overwhelming share of the benefits go to the top? Or will we choose a new path? One that invests in this nation and creates growth that benefits everyone.
"I can’t believe this has to be said, but a teacher shouldn’t pay a higher tax rate than a hedge fund manager."
"My Republican friends are attacking my plan — saying it’s “big spending.” I have to laugh when I hear that one. These are the same folks who passed the Trump tax cuts, almost $2 trillion, a giant giveaway to corporations and the top 1% — and almost none of it was paid for."
"For a long time, this economy has worked great for those at the top. While ordinary, hardworking Americans — the people who built this country — have been cut out of the deal. This is our moment to change that. This is our moment to deal working people back in."
Tune in as I deliver remarks on how we can level the playing field in our economy.
"Yes, we face a crisis with climate change. But we also face an unprecedented opportunity. To create the good-paying, union jobs of the future. To create the industries of the future. To win the future. And to save the planet. We can do this."
"We have the tools to defeat COVID-19, but we just have to finish the job. With truth, with science, and with confidence. Together — as one nation."
15 Nobel Prize-winning economists agree that my economic plan will grow our economy. But it’s about more than that — it’s about deciding that we want an economy that deals the middle class in. An economy where the wealthiest don’t get to write the rules.
"The vaccine requirements under my COVID plan will cover one hundred million workers. Today, I met with businesses that are leading the way. Because vaccine requirements keep businesses open and workers safe."
"I’ve set a course for the U.S. to achieve 100% clean electricity by 2035, and to reach net-zero emissions economy-wide by 2050. We can do this in a way that creates good jobs, lowers costs, and makes us global leaders of entirely new industries."
"Let me be clear: The wealthy don’t need another tax cut, the middle class does. The hardworking Americans who get up every day and make this country run. We’re going to pass a historic middle class tax cut — paid for by making those at the top pay their fair share."

"We have a fundamental choice to make. Are we just going to go back to the way things were before the pandemic, with working people being cut out of the deal — or are we going to build a new economy that gives the middle class a chance? I know my answer."
"Today, another round of payments from our expanded Child Tax Credit is heading to working families across the country. Be on the lookout for a $250 to $300 payment labeled “CHILDCTC” in your bank account. Help is here with the American Rescue Plan."

"For millennia, Jewish communities have marked Yom Kippur as an occasion to reflect and pray; fast and seek forgiveness; account for past transgressions, and commit to future change. Jill and I extend our very best wishes for an easy and meaningful fast to all who observe."
"National Hispanic Heritage Month is a reminder of how much strength we draw from our diversity and immigrant roots. This month, we recognize that Hispanic heritage is American heritage and celebrate the boundless contributions the community has made that make our nation stronger."
"When I ran for President, I promised to protect and build on the historic foundation of the Affordable Care Act. Now, thanks to our special enrollment period, 2.8 million more Americans have the peace of mind that comes with health insurance. This is just the beginning."
Climate change is here — and we need to invest now.
The sacred right to vote is under attack across the country — and we need to take urgent action to protect it. I strongly support The Freedom to Vote Act and thank the eight Senators who came together to draft it. Let’s get this passed.
"We’re going to put money directly into the pockets of American workers by lowering the costs of child care and elder care, and making universal preschool a reality. These investments add up to thousands of dollars in savings each year for working families. That’s a big deal."
"To be clear: If you make under 400k, my Build Back Better Agenda won’t raise your taxes a cent. Not only that — you’ll get a historic tax cut, and see lower costs on things like child care and health care. And all of it will be paid for by the wealthy paying their fair share."
Tune in as I deliver remarks on how we can tackle the climate crisis with my Build Back Better Agenda and Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal.
It’s time the super-wealthy and big corporations pay their fair share in taxes.
"The wildfires in the west are a blinking code red for our nation. That’s why my Build Back Better Agenda includes investments for wildfire preparedness, resilience, and response."
"We can't ignore the reality that wildfires are being supercharged by climate change. And when we invest in climate resilience and infrastructure, we create opportunities for everyone."
Wildfires are gaining in frequency and ferocity — but we know what we have to do. I visited Idaho and California yesterday to discuss how we’re responding to these fires and how we can ensure our nation is more resilient to climate change and extreme weather in the future.
"Look, I don’t want to punish anyone’s success, but the wealthy have been getting a free ride at the expense of the middle class for too long. I intend to pass one of the biggest middle class tax cuts ever — paid for by making those at the top pay their fair share."
"Tune in as I deliver remarks on our response to recent wildfires, and how we can strengthen our resilience to climate change and extreme weather."
"If you make less than $400,000 per year, I’ll never raise your taxes one penny. But if you’re at the very top, it’s time to pay your fair share. We need to reward work in this country — not just wealth."
"With my Build Back Better Agenda, we’re going to cut middle class taxes and lower the cost of living — all funded by making the wealthy pay their fair share for a change. It’s time we give hardworking Americans — the backbone of this country — a fair shot to get ahead."
The fact is a firefighter shouldn’t pay more in taxes than an entire tech company. A teacher shouldn’t pay more in taxes than an oil company. We’re going to cut taxes for the middle class by ensuring the wealthy and large corporations pay their fair share.
"I’m on my way to Idaho and California to survey the damage from recent wildfires and meet with local officials. I’ll discuss our response to severe wildfires, and how we can make our nation more resilient to climate change and extreme weather."
Lower prescription drug costs Universal preschool Free community college Affordable child care Lower health care costs That’s what my Build Back Better Agenda means for you. And we’ll pay for it by ensuring the super wealthy and big corporations pay their fair share.
No one should lose pay to get the vaccine or take a loved one to get vaccinated.
"If you are seeking care at a health facility, you should know that the people treating you are vaccinated."
"We honor all those lost on that dark day, 20 years ago. And we honor those who risked and gave their lives in the minutes, hours, months, and years afterword. We will never forget."
"We find strength in broken places. We find light in the darkness. And we find purpose to repair, renew, and rebuild."
It is always an honor to stop by the Shanksville Volunteer Fire Company. These women and men are the very best this nation has to offer.

"We never forget. We never forget the children who have grown up without parents. Parents who have suffered without children. Husbands and wives who had to find a way forward without their partners. Brothers, sisters, loved ones. Jill and I hold you close in our hearts."

To the Republicans who think the new vaccine requirements are an overreach: have at it. The health of the American people isn’t a game — and it’s time you stop treating it like one.
"20 years after September 11, 2001, we commemorate the 2,977 lives we lost and honor those who risked and gave their lives. As we saw in the days that followed, unity is our greatest strength. It’s what makes us who we are — and we can’t forget that."
"This morning, the First Lady and I stopped by Brookland Middle School here in Washington, D.C. As students head back to school around the country, my Administration is committed to doing all we can to help keep them safe from COVID-19 in the classroom."
"My message to unvaccinated Americans is this: What more is there to wait for? What more do you need to see? We have made the vaccinations free, safe, and convenient. The vaccine has FDA approval. Over 200 million Americans have gotten at least one shot. Do the right thing."
Tune in as the First Lady and I deliver remarks on how the Administration is helping keep students safe in classrooms.
We are going to protect the vaccinated workers from unvaccinated coworkers.
"We have the tools to combat COVID-19. If we can come together as a country and use them, we can reduce the number of unvaccinated Americans, decrease hospitalizations and deaths, and allow our children to go to school safely."
"As we fight COVID-19 here at home, we need to continue our efforts overseas. We are proud to have donated nearly 140 million vaccines and have started to ship an additional 500 million — more than all other countries combined. That’s American leadership on the global stage."
"Today, I laid out my new plan to combat COVID-19 and boost vaccinations. Watch as Press Secretary Jen Psaki breaks it down:"
"The Transportation Safety Administration will double the fines on travelers who refuse to mask. If you break the rules, be prepared to pay."
"In order to better detect and control the Delta variant, I am taking steps to make testing more available, affordable, and convenient. I will use the Defense Production Act to increase production of rapid tests — including those you can use at home."
"I am expanding vaccination requirements to cover those who work in hospitals, home health care facilities, and other medical facilities. If you are seeking care at a health facility, you should know that the people treating you are vaccinated. Period."
"Right now, local school officials are trying to keep children safe in a pandemic while their governor picks a fight with them and even threatens their salary and job. If they will not help us beat the pandemic, I will use my powers as president to get them out of the way."
No one should lose pay to get the vaccine or to take a loved one to get vaccinated. That’s why I’m instructing the Department of Labor to require employers to give employees paid time off to get vaccinated.
"I’m instructing the Department of Labor to require all employers with 100+ employees to ensure their workforce is fully vaccinated — or show a negative test at least once a week. Some of the biggest companies have already required this: United, Disney, Tyson, and Fox News."
"Tonight, I am announcing a new plan to combat COVID-19, building on our whole-of-government approach. The plan will get more people vaccinated, decrease hospitalizations and deaths, and keep our schools and our economy open."
Tune in as I deliver remarks on my plan to stop the spread COVID-19 and boost vaccinations.
I urge Congress to send the bills to my desk immediately. Let’s get this done for the American people.
"This is good news for so many people who have found a new opportunity and a little bit of breathing room as we build back from last year’s economic devastation. With investments in American families and in America itself, we will continue to make progress and build back better."
"With my Build Back Better Agenda, we’re going to ensure big corporations and the top one percent pay their fair share. Then, we’ll use that money to cut taxes for middle class families, lower prescription drug costs, provide universal preschool, and more."
"Productivity in this country has grown almost four times faster than pay, breaking the basic bargain in this country — that if you work hard, and contribute to the success of an enterprise, you get to share in that success. My Build Back Better Agenda will restore that bargain."
"On this feast day of la Virgen de la Caridad del Cobre, Jill and I join those who pray and pay devotion to the Patroness of the Cuban people and reaffirm our commitment to democracy on the island. May the love and compassion of “Cachita” fill hearts around the world."
"Workers who join a union gain power — power over the decisions and the decision-makers that affect their lives. Organizing, joining a union: that’s democracy in action. I want to see Congress pass the PRO Act — and send it to my desk immediately."
"In the economy my administration is building, instead of workers competing with each other for jobs that are scarce, we want employers competing with each other to attract workers. Worker power is essential to building our economy back better than before."
"$163 billion — that’s how much the top one percent evades in taxes they owe each year. It’s unacceptable. We’re going to change that with my Build Back Better Agenda, and use that money to invest in the middle class."
"When corporations and the wealthiest start to pay their fair share, it will put millions of people to work in jobs that will help them punch their ticket to the middle class — and to stay in the middle class. Everyone will do better."
Tune in as I deliver remarks in honor of labor unions.
"Yesterday, I toured communities impacted by Ida in New Jersey and New York. As I told folks on the ground, we’re committed to supporting their recovery and to building back better with more resilient infrastructure. We won’t rest until the job is done."
Should we let millions of children grow up in poverty to protect offshore tax loopholes for the largest corporations? Should we allow climate change to devastate middle class and working families? My answer is no. That's why I'm fighting to pass my Build Back Better Agenda.
"The Affordable Care Act was — and is — a big deal. I’m committed to building on the progress we’ve made since its passing to ensure every American has access to the quality, affordable care they need."
"Tune in as I deliver remarks from Queens, New York on our response to storm damage from Ida."
We’re facing an all-out assault on our democracy. We need to pass the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act to protect the sacred right to vote. I urge Congress to send them to my desk immediately.
"For those big corporations that don’t want things to change, my message is this: It’s time for working families to have their taxes cut. We’re going to create a fairer tax system — and we’re going to build this economy from the bottom up and the middle out, not the top down."
"The irony of ironies is during the recession and the pandemic we inherited, when the vast majority of Americans were struggling to make ends meet, the number of billionaires in America actually grew. There’s something wrong with that."
I’m on my way to New Jersey and New York to meet with local officials and survey the damage from Ida. We’re working around the clock to ensure impacted areas have the support they need to recover and rebuild.
We will recover from Hurricane Ida — together.
"55 of the biggest companies paid zero in federal income taxes last year. It’s just plain wrong. We're going to change that — and use the money we collect to cut taxes for middle class families, make it easier to raise kids and take care of your aging parents, and so much more."
"Labor Day is about honoring the dignity of the American worker. And that’s what our economic strategy is all about, too."
"The middle class built America — and unions built the middle class. Everything that supports a middle-class life was made possible by unions. On Labor Day, we honor all those workers — and their enduring movement — that keep our economy moving and make our nation strong."
"Jill and I extend our warmest wishes to all those celebrating Rosh Hashanah in the United States, Israel, and around the world. Shanah Tovah U’Metukah. May it be a sweet, healthy, and happy new year."
"I believe that given half a chance, there’s not a single thing the American worker can’t do. This Labor Day, let’s celebrate the hardworking Americans who make this country great and recommit to ensuring they’re treated with the dignity and respect they deserve."
"If you live in an area affected by Hurricane Ida, please visit or call 1-800-621-3362 to find help. We are here for you."
"Congress needs to finish the job of passing my economic agenda, so that we can keep up the historic momentum we’ve been building these last 7 months. This is about investing in America’s future, lowering the cost of living for families, and creating millions of good-paying jobs."
"Because of the groundwork we laid with the American Rescue Plan and our vaccination strategy, we are seeing an economy and a job market that can weather the ups and downs of the Delta variant and anything else that comes our way."
To the courageous Afghans arriving in America: welcome home.
"Our economy grew in the first half of the year at the fastest rate in about 40 years. Despite the impact of the Delta variant, what we are seeing is a strong and durable economic recovery. America is on the move again."
"My message to the people of the Gulf Coast — and everyone impacted by Hurricane Ida — is this: We are here for you, and we will get through this together. Keep the faith."
"I know some folks are hesitant to get vaccinated, but the vaccine is safe, effective, and the best way to protect yourself and those you love. I sat down with Stephanie, who got the Pfizer vaccine after it received its full FDA authorization, to talk about her experience."

"The past few days of Hurricane Ida, wildfires in the West, and unprecedented flash floods in New York and New Jersey are another reminder that the climate crisis is here. We need to be better prepared. That’s why I’m urging Congress to act and pass my Build Back Better plan."
"Last night I approved an emergency declaration for California in response to the Caldor fire. So far this fire has burned more than 200,000 acres. More than 4,400 firefighters from the state and my federal team are working to contain and suppress this raging wild fire."

I am launching a whole-of-government effort to respond to this decision -- looking specifically to HHS and DOJ to see what steps the federal government can take to insulate those in Texas from this law and ensure access to safe and legal abortions as protected by Roe.
"The dissents by Chief Justice Roberts, and Justices Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan all demonstrate the error of the Court's action here powerfully."
"Rather than use its supreme authority to ensure justice could be fairly sought, the highest Court of our land will allow millions in Texas in need of critical reproductive care to suffer while courts sift through procedural complexities."
The Supreme Court’s ruling overnight is an unprecedented assault on constitutional rights under Roe v. Wade. Complete strangers will now be empowered to inject themselves in the most private of health decisions. The law does not even allow exceptions in cases of rape or incest.
"In my visit with President Zelenskyy today, I reaffirmed the United States' support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity in the face of Russian aggression, our close cooperation on energy security, and our shared democratic values."
"Texas SB8 will impair women's access to health care and, outrageously, deputizes private citizens to sue those they believe helped another person get a banned abortion. It's a blatant violation of the right established under Roe V. Wade. We will protect and defend that right."
"I look forward to welcoming President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine to the White House today to reaffirm America’s commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty, territorial integrity, and Euro-Atlantic aspirations."
"This week, I met with state and local leaders from communities impacted by Hurricane Ida. It’s going to take a whole-of-government effort to recover, and we’re committed to providing federal support every step of the way."
"The U.S. military, our diplomatic corps, and intelligence professionals did their job throughout this airlift – and did it well – risking their lives to serve others in a mission of mercy."
"Today, I held a call with Secretary Granholm and CEOs of utilities about ongoing efforts to restore electricity to Louisiana and Mississippi following Hurricane Ida. We’re committed to ensuring they have the resources they need to restore electricity in the wake of the hurricane."
I promised the American people I would end this war. Today I've honored that commitment.
"The fundamental obligation of a President is to defend America. Not against the threats of 2001, but against the threats of 2021 and tomorrow. I do not believe the safety and security of America is enhanced by continuing to deploy thousands of American troops in Afghanistan."
"Let me be clear: We will continue to support the Afghan people through diplomacy, international influence, and humanitarian aid. We will continue to speak out for basic rights of the Afghan people — especially women and girls — as we do around the world."
We must stay clearly focused on the fundamental national security interests of the United States. This decision about Afghanistan is not just about Afghanistan. It is about ending an era of major military operations to remake other countries.
"Last night in Kabul, the United States ended 20 years of war in Afghanistan. The longest war in our history. We completed one of the biggest airlifts in history — with more than 120,000 people evacuated to safety. No nation has ever done anything like it."

Our whole-of-government effort is already hard at work. We will be here to help the Gulf Coast region get back on its feet as quickly as possible — however long that takes.
The 13 service members that we lost were heroes who made the ultimate sacrifice in service of our highest American ideals and while saving the lives of others. Our sacred obligation to the families of these heroes will last forever.

How many more generations of America’s daughters and sons would you have me send to fight Afghanistan’s civil war when Afghan troops will not? I’m clear on my answer.
I made a commitment to the brave men and women who serve this nation — that I wasn’t going to ask them to continue to risk their lives in a military action that should have ended long ago.
"I’ve argued for many years that our mission should be narrowly focused on counterterrorism, not counterinsurgency or nation building."
Our current military mission in Afghanistan will be short in time and focused in its objectives: Get our people and our allies to safety as quickly as possible.
"Our current military mission will be short in time and focused in its objectives: Get our people and our allies to safety as quickly as possible. And once we have completed this mission, we will conclude our military withdrawal. We will end America’s longest war."
"I have authorized 6,000 U.S. troops to deploy to Afghanistan to assist in the departure of U.S. and Allied civilian personnel from Afghanistan — and to evacuate our Afghan allies and vulnerable Afghans to safety outside the country."
"Today the terrorist threat has metastasized beyond Afghanistan. We conduct effective counterterrorism missions against terrorist groups in multiple countries where we don’t have a permanent military presence. If necessary, we will do the same in Afghanistan."
American troops cannot — and should not — be fighting and dying in a war that Afghan forces are by and large not willing to fight and die in themselves.
"I know my decision on Afghanistan will be criticized. But I would rather take all that criticism than pass this responsibility on to yet another president. It’s the right one for our people, for the brave servicemembers who risk their lives serving our nation, and for America."
"The events we are seeing now are sadly the proof that no amount of American military force would ever deliver a stable, united, secure Afghanistan. What is happening now could just as easily have happened five years ago — or fifteen years in the future."
"We went to Afghanistan almost 20 years ago with clear goals: get those who attacked us on September 11, 2001—and make sure al Qaeda could not use Afghanistan as a base from which to attack us again. We did that—a decade ago. Our mission was never supposed to be nation building."
Watch live as I deliver remarks on Afghanistan.

There aren’t a whole lot of things that just about every person in America can agree on. But I think it’s safe to say that all of us — whatever our background — can all agree that prescription drugs are outrageously expensive in this country. I’ve got a plan to change that.
"For every other type of health care service, we allow Medicare to use its leverage to negotiate lower prices for seniors. But for prescription drugs, Medicare is prohibited by law from doing so. It’s time we change that with my Build Back Better Agenda."
"Today, one in four Americans who take prescription drugs struggle to afford them. Nearly 30% have skipped doses — or cut pills in half — because they can’t afford the cost. We have to change that. And we can."
"Four years ago in Charlottesville, the battle for the soul of America was laid bare. Neo-Nazis, Klansmen, and white supremacists emerged from the shadows, but Americans of all different backgrounds stood their ground. We must continue to stand up to hate and bigotry — together."

It grows the economy.
"Every American deserves access to safe, affordable housing. My Build Back Better Agenda takes historic steps to make that a reality."

The United States ranks 13th in the world when it comes to infrastructure — and we risk falling even further behind if we don’t act. We need to invest in the future of America again. We need the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal.
Our nation’s public transit systems are inadequate — and it’s got to change. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal will make a historic investment in public transit to modernize and expand public transit in communities across the country.

"When I took office, my Administration knew we needed a war-time effort to get America vaccinated – and to pass a powerful American Rescue Plan. We did both. Now, forecasters have doubled their projections of growth this year to about 7% or higher. The highest in nearly 40 years."
"Folks, we can't go back to the same old trickle-down theories that gave us nearly $2 trillion in deficit-financed corporate tax giveaways and did nothing to make our economy more productive or resilient. We need to grow this economy from the bottom up and the middle out."
"Since I took office six months ago, we’ve gone from 60,000 new jobs per month – to 60,000 every three days. That’s the fastest job growth at this point in any Administration in history."
Tune in as I deliver remarks on our economic recovery and the need for the Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework and the Build Back Better Agenda.
"I look forward to welcoming ibn Al Hussein &amp; Queen Rania Al Abdullah of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan &amp; His Royal Highness Crown Prince Al Hussein Bin Abdullah II, to the White House. We're committed to the enduring and strategic partnership between our nations."
"Happy National Ice Cream Day, folks."
Our children are the kite strings that lift our national ambitions aloft. My Build Back Better Agenda makes once-in-a-generation investments in their care and education.
"With the Delta variant on the rise across the country, it’s more important than ever to get vaccinated. Head to to find a clinic near you."
"With the Build Back Better Agenda, we’re going to lower health care costs by lowering premiums and reducing prescription costs — and we’ll expand coverage. Because every American deserves access to quality, affordable health care."
"This week, payments started going out to nearly every working family in the country thanks to the expanded Child Tax Credit. It’s going to make a world of difference for countless Americans and lift millions of kids out of poverty. Help is here with the American Rescue Plan."
"Whether it’s about my plans to build back better or my love of ice cream, I get asked a lot of questions on the internet every day. So, for this week’s conversation, I sat down to answer a few."
"Days before he died one year ago today, Jill and I spoke with John Lewis for the last time. He asked us to remain focused on the unfinished work – his life’s work – of healing and uniting this nation. With John’s spirit guiding us, we must be unafraid and never give up."
"Well, you know they have to cover me wherever I travel, so the least I could do is make sure they get some ice cream!"
"You’re absolutely right. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal is the largest investment in clean drinking water in history, replacing all the lead pipes and service lines in America."
Read my full statement:
"Yesterday’s Federal court ruling is deeply disappointing. While the court’s order does not now affect current DACA recipients, this decision nonetheless relegates hundreds of thousands of young immigrants to an uncertain future. It is my fervent hope that Congress will act."
"The Build Back Better Agenda combined with the Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework is a once-in-a-generation investment in our nation’s future. Together, they’ll rebuild our infrastructure, invest in families, and combat the climate crisis."
The Build Back Better Agenda starts with education. We’re going to provide four additional years of school to everyone in America — two years of universal pre-school and two years of free community college — and strengthen K-12 education.
"As the first woman chancellor, Angela Merkel’s life is one of groundbreaking service to Germany and the world. Thank you, Angela, for your career of strong and principled leadership, for always speaking out for what is right, and for never failing to defend human dignity."
"Folks, it’s never been more convenient or more important to get vaccinated. Watch Dr. Fauci and _Rodrigo answer fan tweets – and then head to to find a vaccine near you."
"Under Chancellor Merkel, the friendship and cooperation between Germany and the United States has grown stronger and stronger. It was an honor to host her at the White House."
It was an honor to welcome my dear friend Chancellor Merkel to the White House. In today’s meetings we agreed to the Washington Declaration — a document that affirms our shared commitment to democratic principles and pledges to apply them to meet the biggest challenges we face.
Tune in as I host a press conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
There’s just one month left to sign up for health insurance on — with costs at an all-time low thanks to the American Rescue Plan. Sign up by August 15 and join the over two million Americans who’ve gotten covered during this special enrollment period.
"Today, help is here. And my Build Back Better Agenda keeps this tax cut for working families in place for years to come. And so I say to my colleagues in Congress: the expanded Child Tax Credit for working families is something we should extend — not end."
To give you a sense of how transformative the expanded Child Tax Credit is: It’s going to spur the largest-ever one-year decrease in child poverty in American history.
"The expanded Child Tax Credit is one of the largest-ever single-year tax cuts for families with children. And it’s a reflection of my belief that the people who need a tax cut aren’t those at the top. It’s the folks in the middle, and the folks who are struggling."
Tune in as the Vice President and I deliver remarks on the start of monthly Child Tax Credit relief payments.
I look forward to welcoming German Chancellor Angela Merkel to the White House this afternoon for a bilateral meeting. The partnership between our two nations is ironclad — and we’re committed to working together to tackle our shared challenges in the years ahead.
"My Build Back Better Agenda will provide access to quality, affordable child care. Middle-class families will pay no more than 7% of their income for high-quality care for children up to age 5 — and the most hard-pressed working families won’t pay a dime."
"Today is a historic day for our country. Because beginning this morning, nearly all working families started receiving their first tax cut payment from the Child Tax Credit of up to $300 per child. Help is here with the American Rescue Plan."
"Thanks for stopping by, Olivia, and for using your voice to urge young people to get vaccinated. If we all do our part and get the COVID-19 vaccine, we can defeat this virus once and for all. Let’s do this."
"Today, I stopped by Capitol Hill to continue making the case for the Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework and my Build Back Better Agenda. Together, they represent historic investments in infrastructure, clean energy, and families that will create jobs and raise wages."
"This afternoon, I’ll be meeting with a bipartisan group of governors and mayors to discuss the Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework. They know firsthand the need to rebuild our nation’s crumbling infrastructure — and together, we’ll get it done."
Olivia Rodrigo is stopping by the White House today with a clear message to young people: get vaccinated. It’s the best way to keep yourself and your loved ones safe from the dangerous new COVID-19 variants. Head to to find a clinic near you.
"The denial of full, free, and fair elections is the most un-American thing imaginable."
"This year, 17 states have enacted 28 new laws to make it harder to vote. Not to mention the nearly 400 bills that Republican members of state legislatures are trying to pass. This 21st Century Jim Crow assault is real. It is unrelenting — and we will challenge it vigorously."
"To protect our democracy and the sanctity of the vote, we must pass the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. It is a national imperative."
For those who challenge the results and question the integrity of the 2020 election — no other election has ever been held to such scrutiny and high standard. The “big lie” is just that — the big lie.
"Tune in as I deliver remarks on the sacred, constitutional right to vote."
"Today, the U.S. Conference of Mayors — Republican and Democratic mayors from across the country — announced support for our bipartisan infrastructure deal. Mayors and governors know we need to get this done."
"This afternoon, I met with the Attorney General, law enforcement officials, and local leaders to discuss our comprehensive strategy to reduce gun crimes. We’re committed to working together with state and local officials to keep Americans safe."
The surge in gun violence and violent crime over the last year and a half is unacceptable — and we’re carrying out our comprehensive strategy to combat it.
"We need to deal with the shortage of affordable housing in America. With my Build Back Better Agenda, we’re going to make a historic investment in affordable housing — increasing and improving the housing supply by building or rehabilitating more than 2 million homes."
"Gun violence has plagued our nation for too long — and my Administration is taking action to end it. In that effort, I’m meeting with the Attorney General, law enforcement officials, and local leaders this afternoon to discuss our comprehensive strategy to reduce gun crimes."
"We stand with the Cuban people as they bravely assert their fundamental and universal rights, and as they all call for freedom and relief from the tragic grip of the pandemic and from the decades of repression and economic suffering."
More than 65 million Americans have only one reliable high-speed internet provider — forcing them to pay up to five times more on average than families in places with more choices. That’s why I called on the FCC to increase competition and lower prices for Americans.
"Get vaccinated, folks. It’s free, it’s effective, and it’s never been easier or more important."
"A few companies control the market for many vital medicines, causing Americans to pay two-and-a-half times more for prescription drugs than in other countries. I ordered the FDA to work with states and tribes to safely import prescription drugs from Canada to lower prices."
"With my Build Back Better Agenda, we’re not just going back to the way things were before the pandemic. We’re building a new economy that works for every American."
"The American Families Plan is a transformational investment in families — and there’s a lot in it. So, for this week’s conversation, I asked Susan Rice and Cecilia Rouse to break down this important piece of my Build Back Better Agenda."
"Congratulations, Zaila! We’re all so proud of you. I have a feeling this isn’t the last time you’ll be making history."
Let me be clear: capitalism without competition isn’t capitalism. It’s exploitation.
"To keep our country moving, we have to bring fair competition back to this economy. That’s why today, I’m signing an Executive Order promoting competition. It’ll lower prices, increase wages, and take another critical step toward an economy that works for everyone."
Tune in as I deliver remarks and sign an executive order on promoting competition in the American economy.
Congratulations to the Tampa Bay Lightning on your second straight Stanley Cup. You made your city and your country proud.
As I’ve said again and again: The people who really need a tax break in this country are working families. That’s why my Build Back Better Agenda will extend the expanded Child Tax Credit we passed under my American Rescue Plan.
"One year ago, I announced my Build Back Better Agenda. We’ve made incredible progress with our Rescue Plan, COVID response, and infrastructure negotiations — but we’re not done yet. We must pass the remainder of my agenda to rebuild an economy that works for every American."
"When I announced our drawdown in April, I said we would be out of Afghanistan by September. Our military mission in Afghanistan will in fact conclude on August 31st. And the drawdown is proceeding in a secure and orderly way, prioritizing the safety of our troops as they depart."
"With voting rights under attack across the country, it’s more important than ever that we act. Today, the Vice President and I met with civil rights leaders to discuss how we protect the sacred right to vote and ensure everyone can make their voice heard at the ballot box."
"We will never forget those who gave the last full measure of devotion for our country in Afghanistan – nor those whose lives have been immeasurably altered by wounds sustained in service. We are ending America’s longest war, but we will always honor those who served in it."
"We are repositioning our resources to meet terror threats where they are now: across South Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. But make no mistake: we have the capabilities to protect the homeland from any resurgent terrorist challenge emanating from Afghanistan."
Tune in as I give an update on our ongoing drawdown efforts in Afghanistan and our continued support for the ANDSF and the Afghan people.
"This afternoon, the Vice President and I will be meeting with Black leaders of legacy civil rights organizations. We have urgent work before us — and we are committed to doing everything we can to protect the sacred right to vote and pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act."
"Think about this: If you ask the top 1% to pay the same tax rate they paid in 2001, when George W. Bush was President, that would generate $13 billion a year. That’s enough to provide two years of community college free to every student in America. We need a fairer tax system."
"It’s time for us to think bigger, act bolder, and build back better."
We are one of the few major economies in the world that does not cover paid family and medical leave. My Build Back Better Agenda will change that by providing up to 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave.
We can’t wait any longer to deal with the climate crisis. My Build Back Better Agenda will provide tax cuts for businesses and consumers who invest in clean energy technologies — and set a clean electricity standard that moves us to a fully clean and reliable grid.
We are shocked and saddened to hear of the horrific assassination of President Jovenel Moïse and the attack on First Lady Martine Moïse of Haiti. We condemn this heinous act — and stand ready to assist as we continue to work for a safe and secure Haiti.
The fact is 12 years of education is no longer enough to compete in the 21st Century. That’s why my Build Back Better Agenda will guarantee four additional years of public education for every person in America – two years of pre-school and two years of free community college.
"To win the 21st Century, to build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out, to deal everyone in – we need to invest in our people."
Tune in as I highlight how my Build Back Better Agenda will deliver for working families across the country.

"We never again want to be where we were a year ago. While the virus hasn’t been vanquished, we know this: it no longer controls our lives or paralyzes our nation. And we can make sure it never does again. Find a vaccine near you at"
It’s never been a good bet to bet against America.
"Over the past year, we have lived through some of our darkest days. Now, I truly believe we are about to see our brightest future."

"When do and I start, ? Always great to host World Series champs at the White House."

The American people can be proud. Because this country came together and forged a bipartisan infrastructure deal that delivers for everybody. We’ve shown the world — and we’ve shown ourselves — that American democracy can come through.
Tune in as I highlight how the Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework will help communities across the country.

American workers will be installing electric vehicle charging stations and undertaking critical environmental clean-ups. The plan also creates a financing authority that will leverage private capital into infrastructure and clean energy projects.
This agreement will put plumbers and pipefitters to work replacing 100% of the nation’s lead water pipes so that every American can turn on the faucet at home or at school and drink clean water.

"To combat gun violence and violent crime, we’re going to: - Stem the flow of firearms - Advance community policing - Invest in evidence-based community violence interventions - Expand summer programming and employment opportunities"

"Let me be clear: Our vaccination program is an American success story. When we took office, 3,000 Americans were dying every day. Now, hospitalizations have dropped by more than 90%. I’m urging young people to carry us across the finish line by getting vaccinated today."
"When we took office, we didn’t waste a second getting the pandemic under control and our economy back on track. Just five months later, we’ve administered over 300 million shots and unemployment is at its lowest level since the pandemic started. America is coming back."
"At this point last year, the Fed projected 5% growth in 2021. Now, they’re projecting 7% growth. Our economic plans are working — and we can’t stop now."
The Child Tax Credit means help directly in the bank accounts of the families who need it. Nearly all working families will automatically get monthly payments starting July 15th – no action needed. Head to for more information.
"Folks, this Child Tax Credit is a huge step towards a tax system that works for the middle class. It will lift millions of children out of poverty. This is just the first step. My American Families Plan will extend this benefit for years to come."

"Today, I had the honor of signing a bill to officially make Juneteenth a federal holiday. With this important step, all Americans can feel the power of the day, learn from our history, celebrate our progress, and grapple with the distance we still have to travel."
"We cannot rest until the promise of equality is fulfilled — for every one of us, in every corner of this nation. That is the meaning of Juneteenth."
"Today marks six years since a white supremacist took nine precious lives at Mother Emanuel in an act of domestic terrorism. We must honor their lives with action, including reducing gun violence and addressing domestic terrorism."
Juneteenth is officially a federal holiday.
Tune in as I sign the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act into law.
"A year ago, more than 1.5 million Americans filed initial unemployment insurance claims. Last week, that number was 376,000. That’s more than just an economy on the rise — those are lives back on track after an unprecedented crisis. That’s our economic plan at work."
The fact that projected economic growth is near a 40-year high isn’t an accident — it’s because our plans are working.
"A big win for the American people. There’s no better day than today to sign up for quality, affordable health care at With millions of people relying on the Affordable Care Act for coverage, it remains, as ever, a BFD. And it’s here to stay."
"That’s progress, folks."
"That’s a wrap, folks. I’m on my way back to the White House from my first overseas trip as president. After a busy week, it’s clear America is back, our alliances are stronger than ever, and we’re ready to tackle the toughest global challenges of our time alongside our allies."
"Tune in as I hold a press conference from Geneva, Switzerland."
"Today we passed a grim milestone: 600,000 lives lost from COVID-19. My heart goes out to all those who’ve lost a loved one. I know that black hole that seems to consume you, but a time will come when their memory brings a smile to your lips before it brings a tear to your eyes."
"Domestic terrorism is a stain on the soul of our nation, and a threat to our democracy — we need to confront its rise head-on. That’s why my Administration is releasing the first-ever National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism."
"Yesterday, I had the chance to visit the 9/11 memorial at NATO Headquarters. It's a solemn reminder of that awful day and the thousands of Americans we lost. In that moment of peril, our Allies were there for us — and we must always be there for them."
"On this ninth anniversary of DACA, Dreamers deserve lasting stability in the only home they have ever known. Congress must find a way to pass legislation with a path to citizenship for Dreamers, farm workers, and TPS recipients."
Today I met with European Council President Charles Michel and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and we reached an agreement in the 16-year-long Boeing-Airbus dispute. This deal will ensure a level playing field for American workers and companies abroad.
It was an honor to visit the Royal Palace in Brussels and meet with His Majesty The King of Belgium and Prime Minister Alexander De Croo.

"Tune in as I hold a press conference from NATO Headquarters in Brussels, Belgium."
"Our NATO Alliance is stronger than ever. Today I’m joining our 29 allies to discuss our collective defense — including from Russian aggression, strategic challenges from China, malicious cyber activity, terrorism, and climate change."
We’re working to tackle this century’s most pressing challenges – together.
Honored to have met Her Majesty The Queen at Windsor Castle this afternoon.
I had a great meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel today. The ties between our two nations are stronger than ever — and I’m excited to welcome her to the White House next month to continue our work.
"Five years ago, we suffered the deadliest attack affecting the LGBTQ+ community in our history. Within minutes, Pulse Nightclub turned from a place of acceptance and joy to a place of unspeakable pain. As we remember those we lost, we must recommit to honoring them with action."
"As the First Lady says: Any nation that out-educates us will out-compete us. That’s why we’re working to pass the American Families Plan, which makes historic investments in education. Secretary Cardona sat down with teachers to discuss how it’ll help them."
"Today’s news shows that folks are feeling better about the economy. And for good reason: growth is near a 40-year high, unemployment is at its lowest level since the pandemic, and wages are on the rise. Our economic plan is working — and we’re just getting started."
"President Macron and I stand together, ready to take on the toughest challenges we face."

Yesterday I announced that the U.S. will donate half a billion additional Pfizer vaccines to help countries in dire need in this pandemic. In this moment — our values call us to do everything that we can to vaccinate the world against COVID-19.
It’s the first official day of the G7 Summit here in the United Kingdom. I’m looking forward to reinforcing our commitment to multilateralism and working with our allies and partners to build a more fair and inclusive global economy. Let’s get to work.
Our service members are the solid steel spine of America.
"Over the next few days, I’ll be participating in meetings with many of our closest partners. This diplomacy is essential — because no single nation acting alone can meet the challenges we face today, or build the shared future we all seek."
"The special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom is stronger than ever. Thank you for hosting me today, Prime Minister Johnson."
It’s the right thing to do — and the smart thing to do. These vaccines will save millions of lives.
We won’t be safe from COVID-19 at home until we defeat it in every corner of the globe. That’s why we’re donating half a billion vaccine doses to countries that need it most.
The United States is back. Democracies of the world are standing together to tackle the toughest challenges — and the issues that matter most to our future.
"Today, I’m announcing that the United States will donate half a billion new Pfizer vaccines to 92 low- and lower middle-income countries. These Pfizer vaccines will save millions of lives around the world, and be produced through the power of American manufacturing."
Tune in as I give an update on our COVID-19 vaccination program and the effort to defeat COVID-19 around the world.
"On my first foreign trip, we’re going to make it clear — the United States and the democracies of the world are standing together to tackle the challenges of our new age."
I believe we are at an inflection point in history. A moment where it falls to us to prove that democracies will not just endure — they will excel as we rise to seize the enormous opportunities of this new age.
To the members of the United States Armed Forces I had the honor of meeting at Royal Air Force Mildenhall: thank you. You are the best of our country — and the First Lady and I are so proud.
"Today, I’ll be meeting with Prime Minister Boris Johnson ahead of the G7 Summit in Cornwall. I look forward to affirming the special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom and discussing how we’ll tackle our shared challenges together in the years ahead."
"Hello, United Kingdom!"
"Diplomacy is essential – because no single nation acting alone can meet the challenges we face today or build the shared future we all seek. To tackle this century’s most pressing challenges, we have to work together."
Democracy doesn’t happen by accident. We have to defend it. Strengthen it. Renew it. And I know that the American people are up to this job.
America is better positioned to advance our national security and our economic prosperity when we bring together like-minded nations to stand with us. Our unrivaled network of alliances and partnerships are a key American advantage.
Less than 1% of Americans make the choice to serve our nation in uniform. The rest of us — the other 99 percent of us — we owe them.
Tune in as the First Lady and I deliver remarks to US Air Force personnel and their families stationed at Royal Air Force Mildenhall.
"Since we took office, the unemployment rate has fallen and vaccination rates have soared. That’s the American Rescue Plan at work."
"I’m on my way to the U.K. and Europe today for the first foreign trip of my presidency. I know that democracies can rally together to meet the challenges of this new age – this week, in Europe, we have the chance to prove that."
"Folks, Wall Street didn’t build this country — the great middle class built this country. And unions built the middle class."
I’m honored every day to serve as president.
"When we took office, the economy was in crisis. We got right to work delivering much-needed economic relief — and as a result, more than 40% fewer families struggled to pay for necessities like food, rent, and utilities this spring. That’s the American Rescue Plan at work."
"Folks, the Delta variant — a highly infectious COVID-19 strain — is spreading rapidly among young people between 12 and 20 years old in the U.K. If you’re young and haven’t gotten your shot yet, it really is time. It’s the best way to protect yourself and those you love."
"Tomorrow, I depart for Europe on the first foreign travel of my presidency. The trip is about realizing America’s renewed commitment to our allies and demonstrating that democracies can both meet the challenges and deter the threats of this new age."
"I’m working hard to find common ground with Republicans when it comes to the American Jobs Plan, but I refuse to raise taxes on Americans making under $400,000 a year to pay for it. It’s long past time the wealthy and corporations pay their fair share."
To transgender Americans across the country — especially the young people who are so brave — I want you to know your President has your back. During Pride Month — and all the time.
"With the American Jobs Plan, we’re going to make historic investments in American manufacturing to ensure the future is made right here in America."
"We’ve made incredible progress in the fight against COVID-19, but we need everyone across the country to pull together to get us over the finish line. Get vaccinated — and encourage your friends and family to get protected as well. We can do this."
The U.S. is the only major economy where projections of future growth are stronger today than they were before the pandemic hit in 2020. America is on the move again — and we can’t stop now.
We’re growing the economy from the bottom up and middle out. Because it’s long past time every American has a fair shot to get ahead.
We’re getting America back on track.
"I met with survivors of the Tulsa Massacre this week to help fill the silence. Because in silence, wounds deepen. And, as painful as it is, only in remembrance do wounds heal."
Congratulations to the Class of 2021. You’re graduating at an inflection point in our nation’s history – and you have a genuine opportunity to change the trajectory of our country. Seize this moment. I can’t wait to see what you accomplish.
"RT : It's always great catching up with , and I'm grateful for everything he and his administration have done to protect…"
"In our first four months, we’ve created more jobs than any administration in American history. And we’re just getting started."
"Great news folks: we hit record-high health care enrollment. 31 million people now have coverage through the Affordable Care Act. Couldn’t think of a better person to celebrate this milestone with than President Obama, so I gave him a call."
"On the 40th year of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, we remember the lives cut short by this terrible disease and celebrate the resilience and dignity of those living with HIV. Let’s continue to eradicate the stigma faced by too many – and work to end this epidemic once and for all."
The long-term unemployment rate has declined the most since 2011 — that’s the American Rescue Plan at work for American families and the American economy.
"This Gun Violence Awareness Day, I’m wearing orange in honor of the Americans killed every day by gun violence and the survivors and families living with the consequences. It’s a public health epidemic — and it’s time we end it. I urge Congress to take action to save lives."
Vaccinations are up. Jobs are up. Growth is up. People gaining health care coverage is up. Small business confidence is up. America is on the move again.
"In my first four months in office, more than two million jobs have been created. That's more than double the rate of my predecessor, and more than eight times the rate of President Reagan."

Tune in as I deliver remarks on the May jobs report.
"Today’s jobs report shows historic progress for American families and the American economy. We added 559,000 jobs in May, created a record two million jobs in our first four months, and unemployment is at its lowest level since the pandemic started. America is on the move again."
This progress didn’t just happen by chance. We got to this moment because we took aggressive action from day one — with a whole-of-government response.
Unemployment claims are down 50% and 64% of adults are vaccinated since I took office. That’s progress.
"We have a chance, with the investments I’m proposing, to increase the size of our economy by $4.5 trillion over the next decade and win the competition for the future."
"The American Jobs Plan will rebuild our nation’s crumbling infrastructure and help tackle the climate crisis head-on. Watch as Ali Zaidi, White House Deputy National Climate Advisor, explains more in 15 seconds or less."
"Americans can do anything if we do it together. So, do your part. Give it your all through July 4th — let’s get as many folks vaccinated as possible."
Because of our vaccination program and our economic response — America is headed into a summer dramatically different from last year’s. A summer of freedom. A summer of joy. A summer of get-togethers and celebrations.
"America is — and always will be — a nation of immigrants. Our diversity makes us stronger. This National Immigrant Heritage Month, let’s reaffirm and draw strength from that enduring identity and celebrate the history and achievements of immigrant communities around the country."
"Today, we announced a month-long effort to pull out all the stops to free ourselves from this virus — and get as many Americans vaccinated as possible by July 4. Find a vaccine near you at"
Exercise your freedom to live without fear. Get vaccinated.
"Today, we are announcing a month-long effort to get 70% of adult Americans vaccinated. It will take everyone doing their part so we can declare our independence from COVID-19 and free ourselves from the grip it has held over our lives."
"In just over four months, thanks to the American people, we have made incredible progress getting people vaccinated. Nearly 170 million Americans — of every party, every background, every walk of life — have stepped up and rolled up their sleeves to get a shot."
Tune in as I give an update on our COVID-19 response and the vaccination program.
We know from history that bold investments can raise both the floor and the ceiling of the economy for all of us — it’s why I’ve proposed generational investments like the American Jobs Plan. It’s what we need today to succeed tomorrow.
We’re witnessing an all-out assault on our democracy — and we need to act swiftly to protect the sacred right to vote. We need the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act.
We can’t just choose to learn what we want to know — and not what we should know. We memorialize what happened in Tulsa 100 years ago so it can’t be erased.
Tune in as I deliver remarks to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Tulsa Race Massacre.
"Pride stands for courage, it stands for justice, and most of all it stands for love. As we recall the trials the LGBTQ+ community has endured and celebrate the trailblazers who’ve bravely fought for equality, let us recommit to the work that remains. Happy Pride Month!"
"We can’t build back better without tackling the systemic racism and disparities that have plagued our nation for far too long. That’s why today, we’re taking additional steps to advance racial equity, narrow the racial wealth gap, and build Black wealth."
"100 years ago, the thriving Black community of Greenwood in Tulsa, Oklahoma was ruthlessly attacked by a white supremacist mob—as many as 300 Black Americans were killed and 10,000 were left homeless. Today, I’m visiting the Greenwood Cultural Center and meeting with survivors."
"Each year, Memorial Day offers us a chance to reflect on the enormity of the sacrifices that generation after generation of Americans has made."
"On Memorial Day, we honor and reflect upon the courage, integrity, and selfless dedication of the members of our Armed Forces who have made the greatest sacrifice in service to our nation."
We have a sacred obligation as a nation to always honor the memory of those we’ve lost — and to support their families. That is the vow we make each year on Memorial Day.

"We still have work to do, but our future today is as bright and as wide open as it has ever been. This is our moment to rebuild the economy from the bottom up and middle out – and win the competition for the future."
"Thanks to the American Rescue Plan, millions of rescue payments of up to $1,400 have gone out, helping families pay the rent, cover the bills, buy groceries. Those checks mattered."
"Before I took office, average initial claims for unemployment insurance were over 830,000 – and this week we learned that those claims have fallen below 460,000 – down by almost half, and at the lowest level we’ve seen since the pandemic struck."
Before I took office – almost 24 million Americans were going hungry. That number has already dropped by 25%.
My Administration has created about 1.5 million jobs in our first three months in office – that’s more jobs than have ever been created in the first three months of any presidency in history.
I said from the very beginning: there’s no chance to bring the economy back unless we beat the pandemic. I made the vaccine program a priority – and now 50% of American adults and about 75% of seniors are fully vaccinated. We can’t let up now.
America is on the move again. We’ve turned the tide on a once-in-a-century pandemic and a once-in-a-generation economic crisis.
I believe this is our moment to rebuild our economy from the bottom up and the middle out.
"We have a choice to make. We can keep giving every break in the world to corporations and CEOs. Or, we can ask them to pay their fair share and use that money to make two years of community college free for every student in America. I know what I choose."
We have created more jobs in our first three months in office than have ever been created in the first three months of any presidency — about 1.5 million new jobs.
This is our moment to build an economy that rewards work — not just wealth.
The bottom line is this: The Biden economic plan is working. We’ve had record job creation. We’re seeing record economic growth. We’re creating a new paradigm.
RT : We’ve turned the tide on a once-in-a-century crisis.

"We are still awaiting many of the details of this latest mass shooting in San Jose, but there are some things we know for sure. There are at least eight families who will never be whole again. Every life taken by a bullet pierces the soul of our nation. We must do more."

No one should have to choose between a job and paycheck or taking care of themselves and their loved ones. The American Families Plan will finally provide up to 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave.

"If you're fully vaccinated, you can now go mask-less in most settings. But remember: it’s going to take time for everyone who wants to get vaccinated to get their shots, and some vaccinated people prefer masks. So please, if you see someone with a mask, treat them with kindness."
"Every day, we ask a great deal of those who serve in our nation’s law enforcement agencies. As we recognize Peace Officers Memorial Day and Police Week, my Administration is committed to doing everything we can to support the men and women who serve."
"I know folks have a lot of questions about COVID-19, the vaccines, and the latest mask guidance. So, we had the nation’s top experts break things down for this week’s conversation. Check it out:"
RT : We’re wicked excited about the American Jobs Plan.
"It’s long past time Congress pass the U.S. Citizenship Act. Dreamers, farm workers, and TPS holders deserve a path to citizenship. Full stop."
"Since the start of our Administration, we’ve created over 1.5 million jobs. We’ve come a long way, but the truth is we still have further to go. Congress needs to pass the American Jobs Plan which will create millions of good-paying jobs rebuilding our nation’s infrastructure."
This is our moment to build an economy that works for everyone — not just the super-wealthy and giant corporations. Let’s get it done.
"After a long year of sacrifice, Americans who are fully vaccinated can stop wearing masks in most settings. We have more to do — but this is great news."
"Folks, if you’re fully vaccinated — you no longer need to wear a mask. If you’re not vaccinated yet — go to to find a shot, and mask up until you’re fully vaccinated."
"As the holy month of Ramadan comes to an end, Jill and I send our warmest greetings to all those celebrating Eid. May you be well throughout the year. Eid Mubarak."
The rule is now simple: get vaccinated or wear a mask until you do. The choice is yours.
"Just a few hours ago, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the CDC, announced that they are no longer recommending that fully vaccinated people need to wear masks – whether inside or outside."
Join me as I address the new CDC mask guidance.
"RT : According to new CDC guidance, fully vaccinated people can stop wearing masks in most settings. To find a vaccine near you…"
"RT : Big news from the CDC: If you’re fully vaccinated, you do not need to wear a mask – indoors or outdoors, in most settings.…"
"The extraordinary measures my Administration has taken, we estimate, sent enough fuel to gas stations to fill the tanks of over five million vehicles in the last few days."
My Administration has mobilized a whole-of-government response to get more fuel quickly and safely to where it is needed and to limit the pain being felt by American consumers.
Join me as I give an update on the Colonial Pipeline incident.
"Kids 12 and up can now get the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Parents: protect your kids, your family, and your community — get your kids 12 and up vaccinated."
Parents: kids 12 and up can now get the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Go to and find a vaccine near you.
Good news: Adolescents 12 and up can now get the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Hear more from Dr. Walensky about how the COVID-19 vaccine protects kids and their families:
Tomorrow we will cross 250 million vaccine shots administered since we took office. It’s a truly remarkable achievement for the nation.
"Today, an independent advisory committee to the CDC voted to recommend the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for adolescents 12 and older. It’s one more giant step in our fight against the pandemic."
Tune in as I give an update on our COVID-19 response and the vaccination program.
"This morning, Vice President Harris and I met with a bipartisan group of Congressional Leaders. As I’ve said before, we can’t let the divisions of the present stop us from doing right by the future. We’re committed to working together to build back better for the American people."
Today more than 150 million Americans have gotten at least one shot. That’s progress — but we have more to do. Remember: go get vaccinated.
"Today, I met with a bipartisan group of governors to thank them for their partnership in the fight against COVID-19 and to discuss our next steps. This is not about red states and blue states. It’s about what America can achieve when we come together and all do our part."
Every single American deserves access to clean drinking water. Period. We’re going to make that a reality with the American Jobs Plan.
"We’re working hard to ensure transportation is less of a barrier when it comes to getting a COVID-19 vaccine. And I’m excited to share that starting May 24th, Uber and Lyft will offer everyone in America free rides to vaccination sites."
"Today, more than 150 million Americans have gotten at least one shot. Cases, hospitalizations, and deaths are all down. Millions of Americans are starting to live life more normally after more than a year of sacrifice. That’s progress."
Tune in as I give an update on our economic recovery and COVID-19.
"The American Rescue Plan has allocated $39 billion to address the child care crisis caused by COVID-19 so that parents who need to can return to work. The American Families Plan would ensure access to high-quality, affordable child care beyond the pandemic. Let's pass it."
The American Rescue Plan is getting us back on track — but we need to go further. We need the American Jobs Plan.
"COVID-19 has shown us just how necessary it is to center the needs of women and girls in our health care system. This National Women's Health Week, we’re doubling down on our commitment to equal access to health care."
"No one should ever be denied access to health care because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. That’s why today, we announced new protections from health care discrimination. To every LGBTQ+ American out there, I want you to know: the President has your back."
We need the American Jobs Plan. It’s an eight-year investment strategy to make sure the working people of this country get to share in the benefits of a rising economy.
"Since the time I took office, we’ve created more than 1.5 million jobs in the country. It’s the most jobs created in the first hundred days of any President on record."
Tune in as I give an update on our economic recovery and the next steps we’re going to take.
"Checks to people who are hurting. Support for small businesses, child care, and school reopening. Help for families to put food on the table. The American Rescue Plan is working — but we need to go further. We need the American Jobs Plan."
"Don’t forget to call your moms today, folks."
"Happy Mother’s Day to the love of my life and the life of my love, Jill."
"This has been an extraordinarily tough year for moms across this country. To all the moms who have carried us through this pandemic — as frontline workers, caregivers, parents, and more — happy Mother’s Day and thank you from a grateful nation."
"My mom taught me about the importance of family, loyalty, and faith. Her immeasurable strength lives on in all of her children, her grandchildren, her great-grandchildren, and the many other lives that she touched."
"Thank you for tuning into VaxLive tonight. Go get vaccinated, folks."
"We can’t just build back to the way things were — we have to build back better with the American Jobs Plan. The plan will create millions of good-paying jobs, make historic investments in innovation, and position America to win the 21st century."
We have a simple choice to make: We can keep giving tax breaks to the super-wealthy and giant corporations — or we can invest in working families. I’m going to pick working families every time.
I am proud of the people I go to work with at the White House every day — but my pride can’t hold a candle to that of their mothers. Happy Mother’s Day and thank you for raising these public servants.
The American Jobs Plan will get Americans back to work and our country back on track.
It’s time for the wealthy to pay their fair share.
It’s time we build an economy that delivers dignity and gives everybody a chance.
My Jobs Cabinet and I are hard at work making sure the working people of this country — the middle class — are no longer left out in the cold. We’re going to make sure they get to share in the benefits of a rising economy with the American Jobs Plan.
My laser focus is on growing the economy and creating jobs. Now is the time to pass the American Jobs Plan — the American people are counting on us.
"We’re still digging our way out of a very deep hole. No one should underestimate how tough a battle this is. We still have a job to do here in Washington. The American people are counting on us. So, let’s get it done."
Tune in as I discuss the April jobs report.
"RT : Today’s job report showed 266,000 jobs added in April, totaling over 1.5 million jobs created since the beginning of the Ad…"
The American Jobs Plan is about building a strong foundation for the American people.
"I’ve often said: if there are angels in heaven, they’re nurses. Nurses have given so much, and saved so many lives throughout the course of this pandemic. On this first day of National Nurses Week — know that I am deeply thankful, and will always fight for you."
"The American Jobs Plan is a blue-collar blueprint to build America. It will create good paying jobs modernizing 20,000 miles of highways and roads and repairing 10,000 bridges that desperately need to be upgraded."
"Folks, there are no Republican roads or Democratic bridges. The American Jobs Plan is a once-in-a-generation investment in America itself."
"Tune in as I discuss the American Jobs Plan in Lake Charles, Louisiana."
"Right now, the United States ranks 13th in the world in infrastructure. It’s unacceptable. We’ve got to pass the American Jobs Plan and rebuild our nation’s crumbling infrastructure."
"I’m on my way to Lake Charles to discuss the need to create good-paying jobs and rebuild our nation’s infrastructure with the American Jobs Plan. See you soon, Louisiana!"
Our Restaurant Revitalization Fund is helping the hard-hit food establishments that need it most. That’s the American Rescue Plan at work.

"If we want our economy to recover in a way that deals everyone in, then our restaurants need a seat at the table — with the American Rescue Plan, they have it. Thanks to our new Restaurant Revitalization Fund, we’ll be able to help about 100,000 restaurants."
"Our vaccination progress and our economic recovery go hand in hand. Thanks to the American Rescue Plan, more than 163 million rescue payments have already gone out — help is here."
Tune in as I give an update on the Restaurant Revitalization Fund and the American Rescue Plan.
"In case you missed it – the American Families Plan will make community college free for millions of Americans and provide universal access to high-quality, free pre-K for 3- and 4-year-olds. That’s a down payment on the future of America."
"This Missing and Murdered Indigenous Persons Day, we honor the memory of the Indigenous people who we have lost to murder and those who remain missing. My Administration is committed to working with Tribal Nations to ensure swift and effective action."
"In two months, let’s celebrate our independence as a nation and our independence from this virus."
"On this anniversary of the Freedom Rides, we honor those who courageously took a stand against segregation and injustice sixty years ago. Their message of bravery, hope, and unity in diversity continues to inspire us to build a more perfect union for all."
"Our goal by July 4th is to have 70% of adult Americans with at least one shot — and 160 million Americans fully vaccinated. It’s another huge goal, and a serious step toward a return to normal. Get vaccinated, keep following CDC guidance. We can do this."
"It’s easier than ever to find a vaccine appointment. Go to find a location to get the shot, and make an appointment."
Tune in as I give an update on our COVID-19 response and vaccination program.
"The future for American rail is bright. As I laid out at last week’s 50th anniversary event for Amtrak, the American Jobs Plan will invest in rail and ensure it plays a central role in the economy of the future."
Commerce Secretary Raimondo is right: We can’t afford not to rebuild our nation’s crumbling infrastructure and invest in our future. We need to pass the American Jobs Plan.
"The U.S. Refugee Admissions Program embodies our commitment to protect the most vulnerable. It’s a statement about who we are, and who we want to be. That’s why today, I revised our annual cap from 15,000 — a historic low set by the previous administration — to 62,500."
Jill and I visited a classroom today where students are back together with their classmates and teachers. We know what being in school together means for those kids — it’s why we worked so hard to safely reopen the majority of K-8 schools in our first 100 days.
The American Jobs Plan is a blue-collar blueprint to build America. Nearly 90% of the infrastructure jobs created by the plan do not require a college degree.
Families belong together. That’s why I established a Family Reunification Task Force in my first weeks as president. We’re working tirelessly to bring families together — and this week we will begin to reunite the first of those families.
Tune in as the First Lady and I discuss the American Families Plan at Tidewater Community College.
RT : Happening Now: The President and First Lady deliver remarks at Tidewater Community College.
"When I think about climate change, I think about jobs. There's no reason why wind turbine blades can't be built in Pittsburgh instead of Beijing. None."
"Teachers are an extraordinary force for good in our nation — I’m lucky enough to be married to one and have seen firsthand how hard they work for their students. This year teachers have gone above and beyond to help children learn through the pandemic. So please, thank a teacher."
"Last week, I raised the minimum wage to $15 an hour for people working on federal contracts. Now, it’s time for Congress to do its part and make a $15 minimum wage the law of the land for every American. Let’s get it done."
Jill and I extend warm wishes to all of our friends in the Orthodox Christian community observing Easter.
"I have never been more optimistic about the future of America. We have stared into an abyss of insurrection and autocracy — of pandemic and pain — and “We the People” did not flinch. We came together as one America. With light and hope, we summoned new strength and new resolve."
"As we mark Jewish American Heritage Month, we celebrate the contributions of Jewish Americans to our nation. Jewish Americans have helped our nation fulfill its promise and overcome challenges, demonstrating that Jewish and American values go hand in hand."
"Health care should be a right, not a privilege in America."
"On this National College Signing Day, we celebrate all those students chasing their passions and setting the stage for the future. Whether you’re committing to community college, technical school, or a four-year college or university — I'm rooting for you in this next big step."
"This May, during Asian American and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander Heritage Month, we recognize the history and achievements of Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders across our nation — and recommit to the struggle for AANHPI equality."
"Paid leave has helped Eldraen and countless others take time off when they need it most – but far too many people can’t do the same. For this weekly conversation, Vice President Harris sat down to talk about how we can ensure every American has access to paid leave."
"It’s been a big month, folks. We hit our goal of 200 million shots, announced the end of America’s longest war, hosted a global summit on climate change, introduced the American Families Plan, and so much more. Excited to see what we accomplish in May."
"On this momentous 50th birthday for Amtrak, I want to thank everyone whose hard work has kept the trains running and opened up possibilities for so many people over the years. I believe that the best days for Amtrak, for rail, and for America are still ahead."
Let me be clear: No one should have to choose between a paycheck and taking care of themselves or their loved ones. The American Families Plan will finally provide up to 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave for every American.
We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to position Amtrak — and rail in general — to play a central role in our transportation and economic future. To make the investments that can help get America back on track. That’s exactly what the American Jobs Plan will do.
Join me at Philadelphia’s 30th Street Station as we celebrate Amtrak’s 50th Anniversary.
This is a birthday I certainly wouldn’t miss. Looking forward to celebrating Amtrak’s 50th in Philadelphia later today.
"This week, I introduced the American Families Plan. It’s a historic bill that will make transformational investments in families and rebuild the backbone of this country — the middle class. I asked Susan Rice, Domestic Policy Advisor, to explain more:"
"I will not add to the tax burden of the middle class of this country. They’re already paying enough. What I’ve proposed is fair, and it’s fiscally responsible."
Trickle-down economics has never worked.
Madam Speaker. Madam Vice President. No president has ever said those words from this podium — and it’s about time.
"Today marks 100 days since Vice President Harris and I took office, and we’ve been building back better every day since."
It’s never been a good bet to bet against America — and it still isn’t. We are the United States of America. There is nothing we can’t do if we do it together.
"After 100 days of rescue and renewal, America is ready for takeoff. We are working again. Dreaming again. Discovering again. Leading the world again. We have shown each other and the world: There is no quit in America."
"Tonight, I introduced the American Families Plan — an ambitious, once-in-a-generation investment to rebuild the middle class and invest in America’s future. Learn more:"
We’re vaccinating the nation. We’re creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. We’re delivering real results people can see and feel in their own lives. Opening the doors of opportunity. Guaranteeing fairness and justice.
"If we are to truly restore the soul of America, then we need to protect the sacred right to vote. Congress should pass H.R. 1 and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and send them to my desk right away."
"Immigration has always been essential to America. For more than 30 years, politicians have talked about immigration reform and done nothing about it. It’s time to fix it."
I will do everything in my power to protect the American people from the epidemic of gun violence. But it’s time for Congress to act as well. This shouldn’t be a Red vs. Blue issue. It’s an American issue.
We have all seen the knee of injustice on the neck of Black America. Now is our opportunity to make real progress — to bend the arc of the moral universe toward justice.
America won’t back away from our commitment to human rights and fundamental freedoms. No responsible American president can remain silent when basic human rights are violated.
Trickle-down economics has never worked. It’s time to grow the economy from the bottom up and middle out.
A recent study shows that 55 of the nation’s biggest corporations paid zero in federal income tax last year. No federal taxes on more than $40 billion in profits. That’s not right. It’s time for corporate America and the wealthiest 1% of Americans to pay their fair share.
"12 years is no longer enough to compete in the 21st century. That’s why the American Families Plan guarantees four additional years of public education for every person in America — two years of universal, high-quality pre-school and two years of free community college."
"To win the competition for the future, we also need to make a once-in-a-generation investment in our families. That’s why I’m introducing the American Families Plan tonight, which addresses four of the biggest challenges facing American families today."
Doing nothing on infrastructure is not an option. We can’t be so busy competing with each other that we forget the competition is with the rest of the world to win the 21st century.
Let’s pass the $15 minimum wage. No one should work 40 hours a week and still live below the poverty line.
Independent experts estimate the American Jobs Plan will add millions of jobs and trillions of dollars in economic growth for years to come. These are good-paying jobs that can’t be outsourced.
The economy created more than 1.3 million new jobs in 100 days. That’s more new jobs in the first 100 days than any president on record. America is moving forward — and we can’t stop now.
"In my first 100 days, we kept our commitment and we’re sending $1,400 rescue checks to 85% of all American households. We’ve already sent more than 160 million checks out the door. For many people, it’s making all the difference in the world."
"Tonight, I can say because of you — the American people — our progress these past 100 days against one of the worst pandemics in history is one of the greatest logistical achievements our country has ever seen."
"100 days ago, America’s house was on fire. We had to act, so we: - Passed the American Rescue Plan - Administered over 200 million shots - Sent over 160 million relief checks - Delivered food and rental assistance to millions - Provided small business loans"
After just 100 days I can report to the nation: America is on the move again.

When the CDC says you don’t have to wear a mask outside if you’re fully vaccinated and not in a crowd.
"I believe no one should work full time and still live in poverty. That’s why today, I raised the minimum wage to $15 an hour for people working on federal contracts."
"Yes, the vaccines are about saving your life and the lives of the people around you. But they are also about helping you get back to normal living. Go get the shot — it’s never been easier."
"Because of the extraordinary progress we’ve made in the fight against COVID-19, the CDC made a big announcement today: If you are fully vaccinated — and if you are outdoors and not in a large crowd — you no longer need to wear a mask."
Tune in as I deliver an update on our COVID-19 response.
"With the American Jobs Plan, we’re going to bring quality, affordable high-speed internet to every single American — no matter where they live."
"Remember: If you received either the Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, you need two doses to receive the full scope of protection. Don’t skip your second shot."
"I believe every worker should have a real opportunity to organize and collectively bargain. That’s why today, I established a White House Task Force on Worker Organizing and Empowerment — helping empower workers to make the right choice for themselves and their families."
"Today, we’re launching a new program funded by the American Rescue Plan to provide nutrition assistance to more than 30 million children over the summer. Help is here to ensure no kid goes hungry in America."

"To the millions of Americans getting vaccinated every day: your actions are a powerful demonstration of unity and resolve. And a reminder of what we can accomplish when we pull together. Thank you for doing your part to protect yourselves, your loved ones, and your neighbors."
"Jill and I send our best wishes to people of the Jain faith celebrating Mahavir Jayanti. Mahavir Swami guided others to seek truth, turn away from violence, and live in harmony with all beings. May we strive to uphold these values."
"Get vaccinated, folks."
"Just as India sent assistance to the United States as our hospitals were strained early in the pandemic, we are determined to help India in its time of need."
Don’t forget: A special enrollment period for health insurance is open through August 15. Head to and join the over half a million Americans who’ve gotten covered.
Our best days still lie ahead.
"Before I took office, I promised help was on the way. Just three months in, I’m proud to say help is here. We’ve delivered over 150 million relief checks, administered over 200 million shots, and are working hard to build back better every day."
"America has never been unable to meet a challenge if we put our minds to it. I know we can tackle the threat of climate change while seizing the opportunities of a cleaner, stronger, and more resilient economy. Let’s get to work."
"The truth is I’m a union president, and I make no bones about that. I’m committed to strengthening our unions and rebuilding the backbone of this country — the middle class. I sat down to talk with Louis about my plans to make it happen."
"It is time for Congress to eliminate gun manufacturers’ immunity from liability. I thank Congressman Schiff and Senator Blumenthal for their leadership, and urge Congress to swiftly repeal this immunity."
"It’s long past time giant corporations pay their fair share. I believe we should raise the corporate tax rate, then use that money to rebuild our infrastructure, expand high-speed internet, and ensure every American has clean drinking water. Let’s make it happen."
There’s no time to waste when it comes to the existential threat of climate change. That’s why I’ve set a bold new goal of cutting U.S. greenhouse gas emissions at least in half by 2030.
"From the moment we took office, my Administration has been working around the clock to get America vaccinated quickly and equitably. Here’s a breakdown of our progress:"
"No one should be denied a roof over their head simply because of their gender identity. Today, took action to make that clear."
"To all the states, cities, tribal nations, businesses, and organizations that stepped up the past four years to lead on tackling climate change: thank you. Today we announced a new national target and from here on out, you’ll have a partner in me and my Administration."
"We’ve officially passed 200 million shots since the start of our Administration. It’s a big milestone, but we still have a long way to go. Get vaccinated, folks."
"I applaud the Senate and the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus for passing the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act — and for bringing us closer to achieving justice and equality for the AAPI community. Acts of hate against Asian Americans are wrong, un-American, and must stop."
"No nation can solve the climate crisis on our own — all of us have to step up. Today’s Leaders Summit on Climate is our first step to set our world on a path to a secure, prosperous, and sustainable future. Time is short, but I believe that we can and will do this."
"RT : Like millions of smallbusiness owners, Tula feared her business wouldn’t survive the economic downturn caused by the pande…"
"Today, we officially reached our goal of 200 million shots in my first 100 days. Make no mistake: This is an American achievement. It’s a powerful demonstration of unity and resolve. And a reminder of what we can accomplish when we come together in pursuit of a common goal."
America is back. We rejoined the Paris Agreement and are ready to rally the world to tackle the climate crisis. Let’s do this.
The signs are unmistakable. The science is undeniable. The costs of inaction keep mounting. The United States isn’t waiting — we are resolved to take action to combat climate change.
"When I think of climate change, I think about jobs. Within our climate response lies an extraordinary engine of job creation ready to be fired up."
"This Earth Day, I’m proud to say science is back."

"The guilty verdict does not bring back George Floyd. But through the family’s pain, they are finding purpose so George’s legacy will not be just about his death, but about what we must do in his memory."
We can and we must do more to reduce the likelihood that tragedies like this will ever happen or occur again. To ensure that Black and Brown people — or anyone — don’t fear interactions with law enforcement.
This can be a giant step forward in the march toward justice in America.
This can be a moment of significant change.
“I can’t breathe.” Those were George Floyd’s last words. We cannot let them die with him. We have to keep hearing them. We must not turn away. We cannot turn away.
"There’s meaningful police reform legislation in George Floyd’s name, but it shouldn’t take a year to get it done. I assured the Floyd family that we’re going to continue to fight for the passage of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act so I can sign it into law right away."
"No one should be above the law. Today’s verdict sends that message, but it is not enough. We can’t stop here. In order to deliver real change and reform, we can and we must do more to reduce the likelihood that tragedies like this ever occur."
"Today, a jury in Minnesota found former Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin guilty of murdering George Floyd. The verdict is a step forward. And while nothing can ever bring George Floyd back, this can be a giant step forward on the march towards justice in America."
Please join me and the Vice President as we deliver remarks on the verdict in the trial of Derek Chauvin.
"This afternoon, I’m touring the Proterra electric battery manufacturing facility in South Carolina. Tune in."
The U.S.-Japanese alliance is stronger than ever.
"It’s with great sadness that Jill and I learned of the passing of Vice President Walter Mondale, but great gratitude that we were able to call one of our nation’s most dedicated patriots and public servants a dear friend and mentor. Our hearts go out to the Mondale family."
"Today, I brought together Members of Congress for a discussion on the American Jobs Plan. These members are all former governors and mayors, so they understand the issues at stake firsthand. I’m confident that together, we’ll be able to rebuild our nation’s infrastructure."
"Today, the Ingenuity Mars Helicopter achieved liftoff — becoming the first aircraft to fly on another planet. NASA proved once again that with relentless determination and the power of America’s best minds, anything is possible."
"Thanks for tuning into last night’s Roll Up Your Sleeves special. Today, every American 16+ is eligible to get a COVID-19 vaccine. It’s free. It’s safe, and it’s how we’re going to bring this pandemic to an end. Get your vaccine."
"Everyone 16 and older in America is eligible for the shot today. Go and get ‘em, folks."

"As of today, every American is eligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. For yourself, your neighbors, and your family — please, get your vaccine."
Let me be clear: Every American has a right to clean drinking water. The American Jobs Plan will finally make that a reality by replacing 100% of America’s lead pipes and service lines.
Imagine a future where we lead the world and tackle the threat of climate change with American jobs and ingenuity. We can make that future a reality with the American Jobs Plan.
Wear a mask. Stay socially distanced. Wash your hands. Get vaccinated. Now is not the time to let up in the battle against COVID-19 — we have to fight this to the end.
We can’t just build back to the way things were before the pandemic — we need to reimagine and build a new American economy.
Our nation’s caregivers have been undervalued for far too long — and it’s time they receive the pay and benefits they deserve. I sat down with Susie from Texas to discuss how the American Jobs Plan will help caregivers like her.

"Prime Minister Suga — Thank you for making the long trip to Washington, it was a pleasure to host you at the White House. I know we’ll be seeing a lot more of each other in the years to come as we work side by side to ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific region."
I just wrapped up my first in-person bilateral meeting as president with Japanese Prime Minister Suga. Tune in as we hold a joint press conference.

"Equal pay is about justice, fairness, and who we are as a nation — and it makes all of us stronger. I’m glad the House passed the Paycheck Fairness Act to help close the gender pay gap — and I urge the Senate to swiftly do the same."
"This afternoon, Vice President Harris and I met with Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus leaders in the Oval Office. We doubled down on our commitment to combat anti-Asian hate and discussed working together on everything from the American Jobs Plan to immigration."

"When we’ve invested in innovation throughout our history, we’ve been rewarded in extraordinary ways. We have that opportunity once again."
I am immeasurably grateful for the bravery that members of our Armed Forces have shown through nearly two decades of combat and deployments in Afghanistan. They have never backed down. They have never wavered in their resolve. And they have paid a tremendous price on our behalf.
Our diplomacy does not hinge on having U.S. boots in harm’s way. We have to change that thinking.
I am now the fourth American president to preside over an American troop presence in Afghanistan. I will not pass this responsibility to a fifth.
"We went to Afghanistan because of the horrific attacks on 9/11 that happened 20 years ago. That cannot explain why we should remain there in 2021. Rather than return to war with the Taliban, we have to focus on the challenges of the future."
It is time to end America’s longest war. It is time for American troops to come home from Afghanistan.
"This afternoon, I’m announcing the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan and providing an update on the path forward. Watch live."
"In less than three months, we’ve more than tripled the number of daily vaccinations. That’s progress."

"We can’t let the divisions of the moment stop us from doing right by our future. That’s why this afternoon, I brought together a bipartisan group of lawmakers to discuss how we can build America’s infrastructure back better with the American Jobs Plan."
"As the crescent moon ushers in the month, Jill and I send our warmest greetings and best wishes to Muslim communities in the United States and around the world. Ramadan Kareem."

"When I served as Vice President, I asked to be the last person with the President before big decisions were made — and is providing the same counsel to me. She’s the last voice in the room and never fails to speak the truth as we work to build our nation back better."
It’s time we invest in the future of America once again.
Our progress on vaccinations is proof that there’s nothing America can’t achieve when we do it together.
Gun violence in this country is an epidemic — and it’s long past time Congress take action.
This isn’t complicated.
"The American Jobs Plan is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in the future of America. For this episode of our weekly conversation, I invited members of my Jobs Cabinet to break down their favorite parts."
A new study put out just last week found that at least 55 of our largest corporations used various loopholes to pay $0 in federal income taxes in 2020. It’s not fair to the rest of the American taxpayers — and we’re going to put an end to it.
High-speed internet is essential infrastructure in the 21st century.
I’m excited to share my official portrait — and honored to serve as your president every day.
"Universal background checks are supported by the vast majority of Americans — and the majority of gun owners. So let’s be clear, this is not a partisan issue. It’s an American issue."
"Prince Philip’s legacy will live on not only through his family, but in all the charitable endeavors he shaped. Jill and I are keeping the Queen and Prince Philip’s children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and the people of the United Kingdom in our hearts during this time."
"I know that the conversation about guns in this country can be a difficult one. But even here, there’s much more common ground than some would have us believe."
We need to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines in this country. There’s no reason somebody needs a weapon of war with 100 rounds in a magazine. None.
We need more than “thoughts and prayers” from Congress. It’s time to act.
"On this Holocaust Remembrance Day, we remember the precious lives we lost and honor those who survived to bear witness. We must all give anti-Semitism and hate no safe harbor and ensure the atrocities of the Holocaust never occur again."

"Today, I’m joining Vice President Harris and Attorney General Garland to announce new actions to reduce gun violence. Tune in."
Whatever partisan divisions there are around other issues — there don’t have to be on infrastructure. We’re one nation — united and connected.
It’s time we focus on our nation’s caregiving infrastructure — the kind of infrastructure that helps people build a better life and carve out their place in the middle class.
We need to start seeing infrastructure through the eyes of working people.
Two hundred years ago trains weren’t “traditional” infrastructure either — until America made the choice to lay the tracks.
The idea of infrastructure has always evolved to meet the aspirations of the American people — and it’s evolving again today.
We are America. We don’t just fix for today. We build for tomorrow.
"Above all, infrastructure is about meeting the needs of the nation and putting Americans to work to get the job done."
"This afternoon, I’m delivering remarks on the historic infrastructure investments in the American Jobs Plan. Tune in."

Broadband is infrastructure.

"The American Jobs Plan will put hundreds of thousands of people to work building a modern, resilient, and fully clean grid."

"Two years ago, I began my campaign in Pittsburgh, saying I was running to rebuild the backbone of America. Today, I returned as president to lay out a vision for how we do that. We’re going to rebuild the middle class — and this time, we’re going to bring everyone along."
Let me be clear: We’re going to ensure corporations finally pay their fair share.
"The American Jobs Plan will create millions of good paying jobs, grow our economy, make us more competitive, promote our national security interests, and put us in a position to win the global competition with China."
"Historically, infrastructure has been bipartisan. There is no reason it can’t be bipartisan again. The divisions of the moment shouldn’t stop us from doing right by the future."
"In 2019, an independent analysis found that there were 91 Fortune 500 companies that used various loopholes to pay $0 in federal income taxes on U.S. income. That’s just wrong — and we will put an end to it with the Made in America Tax Plan."
The American Jobs Plan is a once-in-a-generation investment in America unlike anything we have seen or done since we built the Interstate Highway System and won the Space Race decades ago. It’s big. It’s bold. And we can get it done.
Here’s the truth: We all do better when we all do well. It’s time to build our economy from the bottom up and the middle out — not the top down.
"This afternoon, I’m in Pittsburgh to discuss the American Jobs Plan. Tune in."
"In the 21st century, in the wealthiest nation in the world, everyone should have access to high speed internet — no matter where they live. We can make that possible."
"I’m on my way to Pennsylvania to discuss my economic vision for the future and how we’re going to build back better for the American people. See you soon, Pittsburgh!"
"Infrastructure isn’t just about roads and bridges — it’s about our global competitiveness. And as we continue to fall back, the rest of the world is closing in. We can’t allow this to continue. We have to invest in America again."
"Over the last few months, we’ve seen the rising cost of our aging power grid firsthand. We can modernize it, make it greener, and create millions of jobs — all at the same time. Let’s do this."
"Far too many Americans lack access to affordable public transit — and those who do have access are often met with delays and disruptions. We have the power to change that, modernize public transit, and expand access for people across the country."

"Every single American has a right to clean drinking water. It’s just plain wrong that in the United States of America today, millions of children still receive their water through lead service pipes. It’s long past time we fix that."
"The Paycheck Protection Program has served as a crucial lifeline for small businesses during this pandemic. Today, I signed the bipartisan PPP Extension Act of 2021 to extend the application deadline and ensure more small businesses can get the support they need."
Nominating judges who reflect America is a top priority. That’s why today I announced 11 nominees — the earliest any administration has announced this many judges in modern history. They represent the best of the legal profession and the diversity that makes our nation strong.
There is nothing America can’t do if we put our minds to it.
"We can’t be silent in the face of rising violence against Asian Americans. That’s why today I’m taking additional steps to respond–including establishing an initiative at the Department of Justice to address anti-Asian crimes. These attacks are wrong, un-American, and must stop."
We have a sacred obligation to care for our nation’s veterans and their families. The American Rescue Plan will help deliver on that obligation by ensuring access to VA health care and providing immediate economic relief.

"Over the last three days, we have had a record number of shots in arms with nearly 10 million shots recorded. That would have been inconceivable in January."
"I’m proud to announce that three weeks from today, 90% of adults will be eligible to get vaccinated — and 90% of Americans will live within 5 miles of a place to get a shot."
Vice President Harris and I just wrapped up a COVID-19 briefing. Tune in as I give an update on our response to the virus and the state of vaccinations.
That’s a big deal.
I urge Congress to pass the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. We need to make it easier for all eligible Americans to access the ballot box and prevent attacks on the sacred right to vote.

"The Georgia voting law — like so many others being pursued by Republicans in statehouses across the country — is a blatant attack on the right to vote, the Constitution, and good conscience. It’s Jim Crow in the 21st Century — and it must end."
"As we recall the Passover story of overcoming adversity, finding hope, and becoming free, we find a renewed salience. This weekend, as Seders close with the familiar refrain, “Next year in Jerusalem,” we offer an additional prayer: Next year in person. Next year, together."
